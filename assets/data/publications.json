      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies reveal gender-specific differences in epilepsy. Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), which is more prevalent in females, is characterized by typical absence seizures (ASs) consisting of brief periods of unconsciousness, associated with 2.5-4 Hz spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Children with CAE often present neuropsychological comorbidities, including deficits in attention and executive function. In this study, we investigated anxiety-like behaviour and memory in female Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), a validated model of ASs, compared to Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) and Wistar rats. We found that female GAERS generally showed normal anxiety-like behaviour relative to both control strains, although some tests suggested a reduction in anxiety. Importantly, female GAERS showed impaired spatial working memory, while recognition memory was preserved. These findings when compared with previous data in males indicate that while anxiety levels in female GAERS are preserved as those of male GAERS, memory performance differs, with males showing impairments in both spatial working memory and recognition memory. These findings emphasize the importance of considering gender differences in both clinical and preclinical epilepsy research to better understand the neuropsychological comorbidities associates with ASs. This knowledge is crucial for the identification of gender-specific mechanism, as well as the development of gender-sensitive, personalized therapies targeting both seizures and associated cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "The integrity of blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers is characterised by their ability to restrict transcellular passage of inert, hydrophilic markers of different molecular sizes by tight junctions between barrier forming cells. Compromised barrier integrity has been linked to many pathologies, including epilepsy. Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats between embryonic day 19 and 21-week were administered an injection of radiolabelled sucrose (342 Da) or dextran (70 kDa) intravenously. After 5 min, plasma, CSF and brain samples were collected for radioactivity measurement. Experiments were performed in drug naïve and valproate (an antiseizure medication) exposed animals. Postnatal rats were provided with a valproate diet (20 g/kg), and fetal animals were exposed to the drug via placental transfer from pregnant dams consuming the diet. Brain cortex and choroid plexus transcriptomes from both rat strains were examined and compared for the expression of tight junction associated proteins. Additionally, differential expression analyses were performed on valproate exposed and control postnatal GAERS pups. Brain/plasma and CSF/plasma concentration ratios of 70 kDa dextran were elevated during a specific period of postnatal development (newborn to 13-week-old) in GAERS compared to age-matched SD rats. In contrast, brain and CSF distribution spaces of sucrose, as well as expression of most transcripts for tight junction associated proteins in cortex and choroid plexus were similar between the strains. Long term postnatal or fetal exposure to valproate reduced the elevated apparent brain distribution space of dextran in GAERS to levels similar to SD rats and correlated with some changes in gene expression in the cortex and choroid plexus. Increased apparent brain and CSF distribution spaces of a large hydrophilic molecule, dextran, but not of a smaller marker sucrose in GAERS implied that while the integrity of brain barriers did not appear to be compromised, its phenotype was distinctly different from that of Sprague Dawley rats. Exposure of GAERS to valproate induced a change in brain barriers phenotype to one more similar to that in Sprague Dawley rats. Understanding potential link between this barrier phenotype and postnatal onset of seizures may shed light on common factor(s) affecting development of cerebral blood vessels and neurons, and their relevance to epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Absence epilepsy is characterized by non-convulsive generalized seizures and typical bilateral synchronous spike-wave discharges (SWDs) on EEG. Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) are known as experimental animals used for the absence epilepsy model, produced from the Wistar strain in the early 1980s. The effect of serotonin on absence epileptic seizures is unclear. In rats, stereotypic behaviors include extremity flexion and extension without displacement, grooming, chewing, sniffing, orofacial movements, head weaving, etc. In a study, GAERS demonstrated more stereotypic activities than naive Wistar rats. Serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission may also play a role in stereotypical behaviors. Aims & Objectives The aims of this study were to evaluate the SWDs analyses of the GAERS during EEG recordings and examination of their stereotypical behaviors in the locomotor activity cage by administering sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant. Method After the recording electrodes were placed using stereotaxic surgery, adult GAERS male rats were divided into two groups (n = 7). EEG recordings were obtained five consecutive days from 09:00 to 12:00, followed by 15 minutes of locomotor activity recording. After the first 60 minutes of the EEG baseline recording; 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal sertraline and vehicle were given to the treatment and control groups, respectively. EEG recordings were continued for 2 hours after the injection. Stereotypic behaviors were analyzed in the locomotor activity cage for 5 days. At the end of the fifth day, the elevated plus maze test was applied to the rats. The experimental groups were compared using 2-way ANOVA and t-test. Results The cumulative duration of SWDs resulted in terms of percentage change compared to baseline in the first 20 minutes after injection significantly less in the sertraline group (54.6 ± 13.6) than in the control group (94.2 ± 8.5) (p=0.03). When SWDs were evaluated generally, no significant difference was found between groups of seizure numbers, average and cumulative durations. The locomotor activity test showed no significant stereotypic behavior differences. The elevated plus maze test showed that rats injected with sertraline for 5 days spent more time in the open field than the control group. Discussion & Conclusion The impact of sertraline on SWDs observed in absence seizures has not been studied before in the literature. Although sertraline reduced the cumulative SWD duration in the early period; analysis of the total SWDs duration showed that parenteral administration of sertraline at the dose (10 mg/kg) and duration (5 days) tested did not affect absence seizures and stereotypic behaviors; however, it resulted in a decrease in anxiety behaviors. Further studies are needed to explain the effect of serotonin on SWDs of absence epilepsy and the stereotypic behaviors of GAERS by using other drugs affecting serotonin metabolism at different doses. This study suggested that the anxiety behaviors that occurred in GAERS have a weak relationship with stereotypical behaviors. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to investigate different neurotransmitters such as GABA, glutamine, and dopamine in this field.",

      "abstract": "GABA, a key inhibitory neurotransmitter, has synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Background GABA, which spills over from the synaptic cleft, acts on extrasynaptic delta subunit containing GABAA receptors. The role of extrasynaptic GABAergic input in migraine is unknown. We investigated the susceptibility to valid migraine-provoking substances with clinically relevant behavioral readouts in Genetic Absence Epilepsy of Rats Strasbourg (GAERS), in which the GABAergic tonus was altered. Subsequently, we screened relevant GABAergic mechanisms in Wistar rats by pharmacological means to identify the mechanisms. Wistar and GAERS rats were administered nitroglycerin (10 mg/kg) or levcromakalim (1 mg/kg). Mechanical allodynia and photophobia were assessed using von Frey monofilaments and a dark-light box. Effects of GAT-1 blocker tiagabine (5 mg/kg), GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (2 mg/kg), synaptic GABAA receptor agonist diazepam (1 mg/kg), extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonists gaboxadol (4 mg/kg), and muscimol (0.75 mg/kg), T-type calcium channel blocker ethosuximide (100 mg/kg) or synaptic GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil (15 mg/kg) on levcromakalim-induced migraine phenotype were screened. Unlike Wistar rats, GAERS exhibited no reduction in mechanical pain thresholds or light aversion following nitroglycerin or levcromakalim injection. Ethosuximide did not reverse the resistant phenotype in GAERS, excluding the role of T-type calcium channel dysfunction in this phenomenon. Tiagabine prevented levcromakalim-induced mechanical allodynia in Wistar rats, suggesting a key role in enhanced GABA spillover. Baclofen did not alleviate mechanical allodynia. Diazepam failed to mitigate levcromakalim-induced migraine phenotype. Additionally, the resistant phenotype in GAERS was not affected by flumazenil. Extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonists gaboxadol and muscimol inhibited periorbital allodynia in Wistar rats. Our study introduced a rat strain resistant to migraine-provoking agents and signified a critical involvement of extrasynaptic δGABAergic receptors. Extrasynaptic δ GABAA receptors, by mediating constant background inhibition on the excitability of neurons, stand as a novel drug target with a therapeutic potential in migraine.",

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is a non-convulsive type of epilepsy characterized by the sudden loss of awareness. It is associated with thalamo-cortical impairment, which may cause neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive problems. Rats with spontaneous absence-like seizures are widely used as in vivo genetic models for absence epilepsy; they display behavioral and cognitive problems similar to epilepsy in humans, such as genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and Wistar Albino rats from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij). Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were apparent in GAERS, but no anxiety and depression-like symptoms were found in WAG/Rij rats. Deficits in executive functions and memory impairment in WAG/Rij rats, i.e., cognitive comorbidities, were linked to the severity of epilepsy. Wistar rats can develop spontaneous seizures in adulthood, so caution is advised when using them as a control epileptic strain. This review discusses challenges in the field, such as putative high emotionality in genetically prone rats, sex differences in the expression of cognitive comorbidities, and predictors of cognitive problems or biomarkers of cognitive comorbidities in absence epilepsy, as well as the concept of \"the cognitive thalamus\". The current knowledge of behavioral and cognitive comorbidities in drug-naive rats with spontaneous absence epilepsy is beneficial for understanding the pathophysiology of absence epilepsy, and for finding new treatment strategies.",

This study aimed to investigate the morphological features of dendrites and dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex and hippocampus of Wistar and GAERS rats. Adult male GAERS (n = 5) and control Wistar (n = 5) rats were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion and brains were removed. Brain tissues were processed by Golgi impregnation method using FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit. Coronal sections were obtained with a cryostat. Pyramidal neurons in layers V-VI of the somatosensory cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus were examined using a light microscope and Neurolucida 360 software. Dendrite nodes, dendrite segments (dendritic branching), dendrite terminations, total dendrite length, dendritic spine density, and dendritic spine types were analyzed. Compared to Wistar, GAERS exhibited significantly higher numbers of nodes (p = 0.0053, p = 0.0047), segments (p = 0.0036, p = 0.0036), and terminations (p = 0.0033, p = 0.0029) in the dendrites of the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus, respectively. Furthermore, the total dendrite length (µm) (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0007) and the density of dendritic spines (1/µm) (p = 0.0168, p = 0.0120) were significantly high in GAERS compared to Wistar. When dendritic spine types were evaluated separately, stubby-type dendritic spines in the hippocampus were higher in GAERS compared to Wistar (p = 0.0045). Intense synaptic connections in the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus of genetic absence epileptic rats led to morphological alterations in the dendrites and the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in these regions, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of absence seizures.",

While the validity of GAERS in reproducing absence seizures is well established, its use as a model for CAE psychiatric comorbidities has been subject to conflicting findings. Differences in colonies, experimental procedures, and the use of diverse controls from different breeders may account for these disparities. Therefore, in this study, we compared GAERS, NEC, and Wistar bred in the same animal facility with commercially available Wistar (Cm Wistar) as a third control. We performed hole board (HB) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests that were analyzed with standard quantitative and T-pattern analysis in male, age-matched Cm Wistar and GAERS, NEC, and Wistar, bred under the same conditions, to rule out the influence of different housing factors and provide extra information on the structure of anxiety-like behavior of GAERS rats. Quantitative analysis showed that GAERS and NEC had similar low anxiety-like behavior when compared to Cm Wistar but not to Wistar rats, although a higher hole-focused exploration was revealed in NEC. T-pattern analysis showed that GAERS, NEC, and Wistar had a similar anxiety status, whereas GAERS and NEC exhibited major differences with Cm Wistar but not Wistar rats. EPM results indicated that GAERS and NEC also have similar low anxiety compared to Cm Wistar and/or Wistar rats. Nevertheless, the analysis of the T-pattern containing open-arm entry showed GAERS and Wistar to be less anxious than NEC and Cm Wistar rats. To summarize, comorbid anxiety may not be present in male GAERS rats. This study also highlighted the importance of including a control Wistar group bred under the same conditions when evaluating their behavior, as using Wistar rats from commercial breeders can lead to misleading results.",

Here we compare the seizure, behavioral, and brain morphometric characteristics of four main GAERS colonies that are being actively studied internationally: two from Melbourne (MELB and STRAS-MELB), one from Grenoble (GREN), and one from Istanbul (ISTAN). Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, behavioral examinations, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were conducted on GAERS and Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) rats to assess and compare the following: (1) characteristics of spike-and-wave discharges, (2) anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and (3) MRI brain morphology of regions of interest. Seizure characteristics varied between the colonies, with MELB GAERS exhibiting the least severe epilepsy phenotype with respect to seizure frequency, and GREN GAERS exhibiting four times more seizures than MELB. MELB and STRAS-MELB colonies both displayed consistent anxiety and depressive-like behaviors relative to NEC. MELB and GREN GAERS showed similar changes in brain morphology, including increased whole brain volume and increased somatosensory cortical width. A previously identified mutation in the Cacna1h gene controlling the CaV 3.2 T-type calcium channel (R1584P) was present in all four GAERS colonies, but absent in all NEC rats. This study demonstrates differences in epilepsy severity between GAERS colonies that were derived from the same original colony in Strasbourg.

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges concomitant with an alteration of consciousness and is associated with cognitive comorbidities. In a genetic model of absence epilepsy in the rat, the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), spike-and-wave discharges are shown to be initiated in the barrel field primary somatosensory cortex that codes whisker-related information, therefore playing an essential role in the interactions of rodents with their environment. Sensory-information processing is impaired in the epileptic barrel field primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS, with a delayed sensory-evoked potential and a duplicated neuronal response to whisker stimulation in in vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, GAERS present no defaults of performance in a texture discrimination task, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism within the epileptic neuronal network. The results of the present study indicate that physiological primary functions are processed differently in an epileptic cortical network. Several neurodevelopmental pathologies are associated with disorganized cortical circuits that may alter primary functions such as sensory processes. In the present study, we investigated whether the function of a cortical area is altered in the seizure onset zone of absence epilepsy, a prototypical form of childhood genetic epilepsy associated with cognitive impairments. We first combined in vivo multichannel electrophysiological recordings and histology to precisely localize the seizure onset zone in the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). We then investigated the functionality of this epileptic zone using extracellular silicon probe recordings of sensory-evoked local field potentials and multi-unit activity, as well as a behavioural test of texture discrimination. We show that seizures in this model are initiated in the barrel field part of the primary somatosensory cortex and are associated with high-frequency oscillations. In this cortex, we found an increased density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in layer 5 in GAERS compared to non-epileptic Wistar rats. Its functional investigation revealed that sensory abilities of GAERS are not affected in a texture-discrimination task, whereas the intracortical processing of sensory-evoked information is delayed and duplicated. Altogether, these results suggest that absence seizures are associated with an increase of parvalbumin-inhibitory neurons, which may promote the functional relationship between epileptic oscillations and high-frequency activities. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits operate differently in the epileptic onset zone and may adapt to maintain their ability to process highly specialized information.",

      "abstract": "Epileptogenesis is the particular process during which the epileptic network builds up progressively before the onset of the first seizures. Whether physiological functions are impacted by this development of epilepsy remains unclear. To explore this question, we used Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERS), in which spike-and-wave discharges are initiated in the whisker primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) and first occur during cortical maturation. We studied the development of both the epileptic and the physiological wS1 circuits during cortical maturation to understand the interactions between them and the consequences for the animals' behavior. In sedated and immobilized rat pups, we recorded in vivo epileptic and whisker sensory evoked activities across the wS1 and thalamus using multicontact electrodes. We compared sensory evoked potentials based on current source density analysis. We then analyzed the multiunit activities evoked by whisker stimulation in GAERS and control rats. Finally, we evaluated behavioral performance dependent on the functionality of the wS1 cortex using the gap-crossing task. We showed that the epileptic circuit changed during the epileptogenesis period in GAERS, by involving different cortical layers of wS1. Neuronal activities evoked by whisker stimulation were reduced in the wS1 cortex at P15 and P30 in GAERS but increased in the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus at P15 and in the posterior medial nucleus at P30, when compared to control rats. Finally, we observed lower performance in GAERS versus controls, at both P15 and P30, in a whisker-mediated behavioral task. Our data show that the functionality of wS1 cortex and thalamus is altered early during absence epileptogenesis in GAERS and then evolves before spike-and-wave discharges are fully expressed. They suggest that the development of the pathological circuit disturbs the physiological one and may be responsible for both the emergence of seizures and associated comorbidities.",

As in humans, the genetic architecture that results in genetic generalized epilepsy in GAERS is poorly understood. Here we present the strain-specific variants found among the epileptic GAERS and their related Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) strain. The GAERS and NEC represent a powerful opportunity to identify neurobiological factors that are associated with the genetic generalised epilepsy phenotype. We performed whole genome sequencing on adult epileptic GAERS and adult NEC rats, a strain derived from the same original Wistar colony. We also generated whole genome sequencing on four double-crossed (GAERS with NEC) F2 selected for high-seizing (n = 2) and non-seizing (n = 2) phenotypes. Specific to the GAERS genome, we identified 1.12 million single nucleotide variants, 296.5K short insertion-deletions, and 354 putative copy number variants that result in complete or partial loss/duplication of 41 genes. Of the GAERS-specific variants that met high quality criteria, 25 are annotated as stop codon gain/loss, 56 as putative essential splice sites, and 56 indels are predicted to result in a frameshift. Subsequent screening against the two F2 progeny sequenced for having the highest and two F2 progeny for having the lowest seizure burden identified only the selected Cacna1h GAERS-private protein-coding variant as exclusively co-segregating with the two high-seizing F2 rats. This study highlights an approach for using whole genome sequencing to narrow down to a manageable candidate list of genetic variants in a complex genetic epilepsy animal model, and suggests utility of this sequencing design to investigate other spontaneously occurring animal models of human disease.",

Absence seizures are characterized by spike-and-wave discharges on the electroencephalogram associated with a transient alteration of consciousness. However, it is still unknown how the brain responds to external stimuli during and outside of seizures. This study aimed to investigate responsiveness to visual and somatosensory stimulation in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established rat model for absence epilepsy. Animals were imaged under non-curarized awake state using a quiet, zero echo time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole-brain hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between states. During a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In the cortex, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The mean-field simulation revealed restricted propagation of activity due to stimulation and agreed well with fMRI findings. Results suggest that sensory processing is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.",

Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were acquired from the 6- and 16-week-old animals to quantify seizure expression. Somatosensory cortex (SCx) and whole thalamus were collected from all the animals to evaluate TARP and AMPAR mRNA expression. Analysis of the EEG demonstrated a gradual increase in the number and duration of seizures across GAERS development. mRNA expression of the TARPs γ2, γ3, γ4, γ5, and γ8 in the SCx, and γ4 and γ5 in the thalamus, increased as the seizures started and progressed in the GAERS compared to NEC.

Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of ACT-709478 in reducing absence-like and other types of seizures in rodents. We studied the effect of oral ACT-709478 on SWDs in two models of absence-like epilepsy, Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats and Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), and compared it to first-line monotherapy. We also assessed the potential of ACT-709478 to reduce generalized convulsive seizures in audiogenic seizure-sensitive (AGS) mice and in the maximal electroshock threshold test (MEST) in mice, as well as in one model of focal onset seizures, the amygdala kindling rat model. We tested combinations of ACT-709478 with the broadly used first-line medication valproate in AGS mice. ACT-709478 suppressed SWDs in WAG/Rij rats and GAERS with efficacy equivalent to or superior to that of first-line monotherapy. ACT-709478 also reduced the severity of generalized convulsive seizures in the AGS mouse model and the MEST in mice, albeit at higher concentration. ACT-709478 had synergistic effects against generalized convulsive seizures, when combined with valproate, and had no effect on focal onset seizures. Based on its efficacy profile in rodent models, ACT-709478 represents a promising drug candidate for the treatment of absence epilepsy such as childhood absence epilepsy or syndromes featuring SWDs.

Cumulative amygdala AD duration was significantly higher in male Wistar rats compared to male GAERS (p=0.001) and female GAERS (p=0.01). However, no significant difference in cumulative amygdala AD duration was observed between male and female GAERS (p=0.94).\nConclusion: We have confirmed that this resistance also applies to female GAERS.

During pregnancy, its use has been shown to increase the risk of neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. The present study used a rat model of absence epilepsy, Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), to investigate the effects of gestational valproate exposure on early postnatal brain cortex and lateral choroid plexus transcriptomes. Females were provided with either a control diet or a valproate-laced diet (20 g/kg) from 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout gestation. At parturition, all dams received a control diet. Pups at Postnatal Day 5 were used for RNA sequencing. Differential expression analyses were conducted between transcriptomes from valproate-exposed and control animals. In the choroid plexus, 5694 genes significantly altered their expression compared to 214 in the cortex, a difference of nearly 25 times. Dysregulation was identified in choroidal expression of ion channels and metal transporters including six members of the Slc4a family, Cacna1h and Kcne2. Several drug transporting ATP-binding cassette transporters and solute carriers were significantly upregulated and drug-metabolising enzymes downregulated. In the cortex, 11 genes associated with the development of the central nervous system were differentially expressed. Finally, in both tissues, foetal valproate exposure appeared to result in dysregulation of genes related to adaptive and innate immune responses. These results indicated that gestational exposure to valproate resulted in distinct and greater effects on the choroid plexus transcriptome compared to the cortex, potentially suggesting additional targets related to developmental valproate neurotoxicity.",

We aimed to compare the effects of LEV in two epilepsy models: the kindling model for temporal lobe epilepsy and the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model for absence epilepsy.\nMethods: GAERS and Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic surgery for cortical recording electrodes implantation, while bipolar stimulation electrodes were implanted in the right basolateral amygdala of Wistar rats for kindling stimulations. For the kindling procedure, Wistar rats were stimulated at after discharge (AD) threshold twice daily. After three consecutive stage five seizures, the animals were considered kindled and randomly divided into two groups. Kindled animals received intraperitoneal injection of either saline or 100 mg/kg LEV 1 hour before stimulation. Seizure stage, amygdala AD, and total seizure duration were evaluated. GAERS rats were randomly divided into two groups, and spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) were recorded for 2 hours after intraperitoneally injecting 100 mg/kg LEV or saline. Cumulative SWD duration, number of SWDs, and mean duration of an individual SWD were compared with the saline-treated control group.\nResults: LEV significantly reduced the seizure severity and AD duration compared to controls. The mean seizure stage was 1.42±0.29 in the LEV group (p<0.0001) while all saline-treated kindled animals reached stage 5 seizure. LEV also lowered the total seizure duration (13.14±1.11 s) significantly compared to vehicle (86.76±12.59 s; p<0.005). In GAERS group, LEV suppressed the SWDs around 40 min after injection, and this anti-seizure effect lasted until the end of a 2-hour electroencephalography recording.\nConclusion: LEV, at a dose, 100 mg/kg, effectively reduced convulsive and non-convulsive seizures in two different epilepsy models. These results underscore the efficacy of LEV in mitigating seizure severity and duration across different epilepsy types, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for managing both focal and absence seizures.",

      "abstract": "The Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) is a genetic model, derived from Wistar rats by selective breeding. In all previous studies, GAERS were compared to their paired selected strain not expressing spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), namely nonepileptic controls (NECs). Because the occurrence/absence of SWDs is of polygenic origin, some other traits could have been selected along with occurrence/absence of SWDs. Therefore, we explored the importance of using a second control group consisting in Wistar rats, the strain of origin of GAERS, in addition to NECs, on locomotion and anxiety in GAERS. A test battery encompassing home-cage, open-field, beam-walking and elevated plus-maze evaluations was used. In addition, stereologic analyses were performed to assess the volume of thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The occurrence/absence of SWDs was determined in all three strains by electroencephalography (EEG) recording. When compared to NECs and Wistars, GAERS displayed lower exploratory activity and fastened habituation to novelty. In the plus-maze, scores of GAERS and Wistars were similar, but NECs appeared significantly less anxious (possibly in association with increased amygdala volume); evidence for weaker anxiety in NECs was also found in the open-field evaluation. The volumetric study revealed increased thalamic volume in GAERS compared to both control groups. SWDs were present in all GAERS and in 80% of Wistars. Compared to the original Wistar strain as an additional control group, the selective breeding that generated the GAERS has no incidence on anxiety-related behavior, conversely to the selection of SWD suppression in NECs, in which anxiety is attenuated. These findings point to the importance of using a second control group composed of Wistar rats in studies characterizing the behavioral profile of GAERS. Thereby, possible confusions between occurrence/absence of SWDs and other features that come along with selection and/or differential brain development induced by the genetic mutations are reduced.",

ENX-101 is a deuterated analog of the ⍺2,3,5-selective GABAreceptor PAM L-838,417. The purpose of this study was to characterize the α-subunit selectivity of ENX-101 and evaluate its antiseizure potential in preclinical seizure and epilepsy models. ENX-101 potentiation of GABA chloride current responses in cells expressing recombinant GABAreceptors were evaluated using an automated patch clamp assay. Antiseizure effects of ENX-101 were examined in the mouse 6 Hz test at 32 and 44 mA, amygdala kindled rats, and Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). ENX-101 displayed partial PAM activity with respect to diazepam at GABAreceptors containing α2, α3, or α5 subunits but did not enhance GABA responses of GABAreceptors containing α1 subunits. ENX-101 (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam protected most animals in the 6 Hz model at 32 mA but was less effective at 44 mA. In amygdala kindled rats, ENX-101 (1-100 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced behavioral seizure severity and afterdischarge duration in a dose-dependent manner. ENX-101 (0.075-100 mg/kg, p.o.) caused dose-dependent, persistent (>130 min) inhibition of spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in GAERS, whereas diazepam transiently inhibited discharges. ENX-101 did not cause motor impairment, as measured by performance in the rotarod assay. ENX-101 is an α2,α3,α5-selective GABAreceptor PAM that has high potency and partial efficacy. The drug is highly effective in rodent seizure and epilepsy models. ENX-101 is most potent in the GAERS model of absence epilepsy, and active in the 6 Hz model and amygdala kindled rats. These results demonstrate that a partial, subtype-selective GABAreceptor PAM has activity in translationally validated preclinical epilepsy screening models. Clinical evaluation of ENX-101 as a treatment for focal and generalized epilepsies is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) represent a model of genetic generalized epilepsy. The present longitudinal study in GAERS and age-matched non-epileptic controls (NEC) aimed to characterize the epileptic brain network using two functional measures, resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) combined with morphometry, and to investigate potential brain network alterations, following long-term seizure activity. Repeated rs-fMRI measurements at 9.4 T between 3 and 8 months of age were combined with MEMRI at the final time point of the study. We used graph theory analysis to infer community structure and global and local network parameters from rs-fMRI data and compared them to brain region-wise manganese accumulation patterns and deformation-based morphometry (DBM). Functional connectivity (FC) was generally higher in GAERS when compared to NEC. Global network parameters and community structure were similar in NEC and GAERS, suggesting efficiently functioning networks in both strains. No progressive FC changes were observed in epileptic animals. Network-based statistics (NBS) revealed stronger FC within the cortical community, including regions of association and sensorimotor cortex, and with basal ganglia and limbic regions in GAERS, irrespective of age. Higher manganese accumulation in GAERS than in NEC was observed at 8 months of age, consistent with higher overall rs-FC, particularly in sensorimotor cortex and association cortex regions. Functional measures showed less similarity in subcortical regions. Whole brain volumes of 8 months-old GAERS were higher when compared to age-matched NEC, and DBM revealed increased volumes of several association and sensorimotor cortex regions and of the thalamus. rs-fMRI, MEMRI, and volumetric data collectively suggest the significance of cortical networks in GAERS, which correlates with an increased fronto-central connectivity in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Our findings also verify involvement of basal ganglia and limbic regions. Epilepsy-related network alterations are already present in juvenile animals. Consequently, this early condition seems to play a greater role in dynamic brain function than chronic absence seizures.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential of alpha 2A agonism to induce seizures during the pre-epileptic period in GAERS rats. Stereotaxic surgery was performed on male pups and adult GAERS rats to implant recording electrodes in the frontoparietal cortices (right/left) under anesthesia (PN23-26). Following the recovery period, pup GAERS rats were subjected to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings for 2 h. Before the injections, pup epileptiform activity was examined using baseline EEG data. Dexmedetomidine was acutely administered at 0.6 mg/kg to pup GAERS rats 2-3 days after the surgery and once during the post-natal (PN) days 25-29. Epileptiform activities before injections triggered unilateral SWDs and induced sleep durations, and power spectral density was evaluated based on EEG traces. The most prominent finding of this study is that unilateral SWD-like activities were induced in 47% of the animals with the intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine injection. The baseline EEGs of pup GAERS rats had no SWDs as expected since they are in the pre-epileptic period but showed low-amplitude non-rhythmic epileptiform activity. There was no difference in the duration of epileptiform activities between the basal EEG groups and DEX-injected unilateral SWD-like-exhibiting and non-SWD-like activities groups; however, the sleep duration of the unilateral SWD-like-exhibiting group was shorter. Power spectrum density (PSD) results revealed that the 1.75-Hz power in the left hemisphere peaks significantly higher than in the right. As anticipated, pup GAERS rats in the pre-epileptic stage showed no SWDs. Nevertheless, they exhibited sporadic epileptiform activities. Specifically, dexmedetomidine induced SWD-like activities solely within the left hemisphere. These observations imply that absence seizures might originate unilaterally in the left cortex due to αAR agonism. Additional research is necessary to explore the precise cortical focal point of this activity.",

BAER-101 has been administered to over 700 healthy human volunteers and patients where it was found to be safe and well tolerated. To test the extent of the antiseizure activity of BAER-1010, we tested BAER-101 in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model, a widely used and translationally relevant model. GAERS rats with recording electrodes bilaterally located over the frontal and parietal cortices were used. Electroencepholographic (EEG) signals in freely moving awake rats were analyzed for spike-wave discharges (SWDs). BAER-101 was administered orally at doses of 0.3-100 mg/kg and diazepam was used as a positive control using a cross-over protocol with a wash-out period between treatments. The number of SWDs was dose-dependently reduced by BAER-101 with 0.3 mg/kg being the minimally effective dose (MED). The duration of and total time in SWDs were also reduced by BAER-101. Concentrations of drug in plasma achieved an MED of 10.1 nM, exceeding the Kfor α2 or α3, but 23 times lower than the Kfor α5-GABAARs. No adverse events were observed up to a dose 300× MED. The data support the possibility of antiseizure efficacy without the side effects associated with other GABAAR subtypes. This is the first report of an α2/3-selective GABA PAM suppressing seizures in the GAERS model. The data encourage proceeding to test BAER-101 in patients with epilepsy.",

We recorded seizures over periods of several days in the Genetic Absence Epileptic Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS) model of absence epilepsy, while we monitored behavioral activity with a combined head accelerometer (ACCEL), neck electromyogram (EMG), and electrooculogram (EOG). The three markers consistently discriminated between states of behavioral activity and rest. Both GAERS and control Wistar rats spent more time in rest (55-66%) than in activity (34-45%), yet GAERS showed prolonged continuous episodes of activity (23 vs. 18 min) and rest (34 vs. 30 min). On average, seizures lasted 13 s and were separated by 3.2 min. Isolated seizures were associated with a decrease in the power of the activity markers from steep for ACCEL to moderate for EMG and weak for EOG, with ACCEL and EMG power changes starting before seizure onset. Seizures tended to occur in bursts, with the probability of seizing significantly increasing around a seizure in a window of ±4 min. Furthermore, the seizure rate was strongly increased for several minutes when transitioning from activity to rest. These results point to mechanisms that control behavioral states as determining factors of seizure occurrence.",

Each animal received the following six treatments as a single, intraperitoneal dose, 7 days apart (in random order): huperzine A (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg), two periods of vehicle (0.9% NaCl), or ethosuximide (100 mg/kg) as a positive control. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were acquired for 24 h before and after each treatment and analyzed for seizure activity during the 90-min period immediately post-treatment, including 30-min intervals at 30, 60, and 90 min. Additional analyses evaluated seizure activity over the 24-h post-treatment period using 60-min intervals at 6, 12, and 24 h. The cumulative 24-h periods before and after each administered treatment were also compared. Two-way ANOVA showed a treatment difference [F = 3.592, p < 0.0001] on the number of seizures over the first 90-min post-treatment (primary outcome); Tukey's post hoc analyses showed that, compared to vehicle, huperzine A (3.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced seizures in the 30-min (p = 0.02) and 60-min (p = 0.001) intervals, and ethosuximide significantly reduced seizures at all measured time intervals except the 1-h blocks at 12 and 24 h. Huperzine A 3.0 mg/kg and ethosuximide significantly reduced seizures during the cumulative 24-h post-treatment period relative to pretreatment baseline. While huperzine A 3.0 mg/kg did not differ significantly from ethosuximide at any time point, the study was not designed to evaluate non-inferiority. The only adverse event after huperzine A or ethosuximide was mild, dose-dependent sedation. Huperzine A potently suppressed absence-like seizures in GAERS, albeit with a shorter duration of action relative to ethosuximide, showing promise for clinical efficacy in GGE. This study looked at how huperzine A affects seizures in rats with similar abnormal brain activity as seen in humans with absence epilepsy. Rats received different treatments, placebo (i.e., saline solution), huperzine A, and ethosuximide. Ethosuximide is considered a gold standard treatment for absence epilepsy. We recorded brain activity to measure seizures before and after each treatment. We found that huperzine A (3.0 mg/kg) reduced seizures soon after treatment, like ethosuximide. Both treatments appeared safe, causing only mild sleepiness. The study shows that huperzine A could be a good new treatment for a type of absence epilepsy.",

Z944 (10 mg/kg; ip) was administered 15 min prior to either acquisition, extinction day 1 (24 hr later), acquisition and extinction day 1, or during the consolidation (post-acquisition) of tone-cued fear conditioning. Extinction was examined 24 and 48 hr after conditioning. In drug naïve GAERS, increased freezing during the acquisition and extinction phases of fear conditioning was found. Short-term effects of Z944 on performance were observed as Z944 increased freezing during testing on the day it was administered. Z944 administered prior to the acquisition phase had a long-term effect on extinction. Specifically, both GAERS and NECs showed a decrease in freezing during extinction relative to drug naïve GAERS and NEC rats respectively. Regardless of strain or treatment, female rats showed reduced extinction of fear relative to male rats. These results demonstrate that T-type calcium channels contribute to the neural systems that mediate the learning and memory of conditioned fear. Overall, these findings suggest that T-type calcium channel blockers show promise in the treatment of learning impairments observed in disorders such as CAE.",

      "abstract": "This study builds upon our prior investigation proposing a potential animal model for absence status epilepticus induced by specific alpha-2a adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) activation through intracerebroventricular injection of dexmedetomidine (DEX). Our objective was to explore trace element levels within the cortex of genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) during absence status induction through α2AAR activation. Stereotaxic surgery was performed on adult GAERS to implant recording electrodes in the frontoparietal cortices under anesthesia. Following intracerebroventricular injection of the α2AAR agonist, DEX, the electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. After inducing the second period of absence statuses, the rats were euthanized. Trace elements were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) among the groups: GAERS-NAÏVE, GAERS injected with saline (GAERS-SAL), and GAERS injected with DEX (GAERS-DEX). No significant differences of the levels of trace elements were observed in the GAERS-DEX group compared to GAERS-SAL following absence status induction. Conversely, significant differences in trace element levels were identified between the GAERS-NAÏVE and GAERS-SAL or GAERS-DEX groups. Cortical levels of 25Mg, 55Mn, 57Fe, 88Sr, 65Cu, 42Mo, 80Hg, 15P, 52Cr, 59Co, 66Zn, 82Se, 85Rb, 133Cs, and 205Tl were higher in the GAERS-NAÏVE group compared to GAERS-SAL (p < 0.05). Similarly, hippocampal levels of 25Mg, 43Ca, 55Mn, 57Fe, 88Sr, 65Cu, 42Mo, 80Hg, 15P, 52Cr, 59Co, 66Zn, 82Se, 85Rb, 133Cs, and 205Tl were higher in the GAERS-NAÏVE group compared to the GAERS-SAL group (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that DEXinduced absence status does not alter trace element levels in the cortex and hippocampus, unlike convulsive forms of epilepsies. However, the influence of trace element modulations on the development of absence status remains open to discussion. Intriguingly, cannula placement appeared to affect trace element levels, prompting inquiries into the current methodology of intracerebroventricular cannula implementation.",

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is marked by sudden lapses in consciousness accompanied by spike-wave discharges (SWDs), yet the neural mechanisms underlying impaired sensorimotor processing in these episodes remain unresolved. Prior work has shown that normal-appearing signals can persist in primary sensory cortical areas during seizures, suggesting that impaired behavioral responsiveness may arise from disruptions in higher-order association cortex. To investigate this hypothesis, we combined behavioral testing with simultaneous local field potential recordings in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Rats were trained in an auditory conditioned response task, allowing comparison of tone-evoked responses during interictal baseline and ictal SWDs. We found that behavioral performance collapsed during SWDs, with correct responses falling from ∼88% at baseline to <1% during SWDs (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, auditory event-related potentials in primary auditory cortex (Au1) during SWDs were not significantly decreased. In contrast, we identified a novel oscillatory evoked potential in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) that was robust in controls, attenuated in GAERS at baseline, and markedly reduced during SWDs. Notably, reductions in AIC response magnitude also occurred during satiated, unmotivated states, but waveform structure was preserved, distinguishing motivational modulation from seizure-related disruption. These results demonstrate that absence seizures selectively impair signals in the anterior insula rather than in primary auditory cortex, identifying the AIC as a potentially critical hub for gating auditory conscious awareness. Beyond refining models of seizure-related unconsciousness, the discovery of an insular oscillatory potential highlights a candidate biomarker and intervention target for absence epilepsy, with broader implications for understanding impaired consciousness in anesthesia, sleep, and brain injury.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The hypotheses related to the fact of epileptic mechanisms are mainly based on excitation-inhibition imbalance in central nervous system. GAERS (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg) is a well-known animal model of absence epilepsy, and frequently used in experimental studies. In the present study, we aimed to examine possible morphological and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) density changes in GAERS hippocampus after electrical kindling stimulations. \nMethods: All control and test group rats received 6 kindling stimulations. Rats were decapitated 1 h after the last stimulation. Ultrastructural GABA immunocytochemistry was used to evaluate GABA density quantitatively in mossy terminals of hippocampal CA3 region. \nResults: GABA levels were less in kindling groups compared to their controls, and in GAERS groups compared to Wistar groups; mitochondrial and dendritic spine area ratios were greater in GAERS groups compared to Wistar groups, although all these evaluations were statistically nonsignificant. Depletion of synaptic vesicles was evident in the mossy terminals of kindling groups. \nConclusion: The reason of decreased levels of GABA found in the present study might be that GABA has been released from the synaptic pool rapidly at an early time period after the last stimulation, for compansation mechanisms. Depletion of synaptic vesicles observed in kindling groups shows that even 6 kindling stimulations have an impact of changing hippocampal morphology in trisynaptic cycle. The increased mitochondrial area in GAERS might be related to the increased mitochondrial activity. The increased dendritic spine area might be related to the increased performance of learning in GAERS. Our findings indicating that absence epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy have different mechanisms of epileptogenesis might be a basis for further experimental studies",

This model displays the electro-clinical, behavioural, and pharmacological features of absence seizures. Although GAERS share typical characteristics, including spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in the electroencephalography (EEG), age-dependent studies with these animals have not yet been reported. The aim of the present study is to perform a systematic comparison contrasting the SWDs of young and older GAERS, in terms of the number, duration, frequency, and waveform morphology of the discharges, as well as the pre-SWD EEG characteristics, using identical measurement and analysis techniques. The number, cumulative total duration and mean duration of SWDs were significantly higher in young GAERS (4 to 6 months) compared to older GAERS (12 to 14 months). Furthermore, the SWD spectra and average SWD waveforms indicated that a single cycle of the SWD contains more energy in faster components, such as increased spikes and higher power, in the SWDs of the young GAERS. Additionally, older GAERS showed weak amplitude spikes in SWDs and higher power pre-SWDs. These clear morphological differences in the EEGs of young and older GAERS rats should be further examined in future studies that explore new dimensions of genetic absence epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The SLIT and NTRK-like 1 (SLITRK1) gene 1 is one risk gene of Tourette syndrome (TS), a neurodevelopmental tic disorder. Slitrk1 protein is involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation in striatum 2. Developmentally regulated expression of striatal Slitrk1 In mammals 3 and striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) loss in adult TS patients 4 have been reported. Hence, a novel mice model has been developed based on the correlation of Slitrk1 knockdown (Slitrk1-KD )and dysfunction of striatal ChIs 5. The alpha-6GABAA receptors (alpha-6GABAARs) are densely expressed in granule cells of cerebellum, which is also a novel therapeutic target for TS. Aims & Objectives We aimed to investigate the role of Slitrk1 in the pathogenesis of TS and the therapeutic potential of pyrazoloquinolinones (PQs) Compound 6, as alpha-6GABAAR positive allosteric modulators (PAM) 6,on the Slitrk1-KD TS mice model. Methods Slitrk1 or scrambled siRNA was bilaterally injected into the dorsal striatum of adult C57Bl/ 6J male mice, creating Slitrk1-KD and control mice, respectively. Their stereotypic tic behaviors, prepulse inhibition (PPI), and sensorymotor function were compared. We also investigated dopamine(DA) and acetylcholine (AC) levels in microdialysates, Slitrk1 protein and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels, numbers of Slitrk1-positive ChIs in the striatum, as well as electrophysiological properties between Slitrk1-positive and Slitrk1-negative striatal ChIs. We further applied PQs Compound 6 on this model to observe its therapeutic effect. Results As compared with the control group, Slitrk1-KD mice show significantly more stereotypic tic behaviors and sensori-motor dysfunction. These TS-associated behaviors are correlated with fewer Slitrk1-containing ChIs in Slitrk1-KD mice. Slitrk1-KD mice have lower evoked DA and AC levels, higher tonic DA levels, and down-regulated DAT in the striatum. Injection (i.p) of PQs Compound 6 could suppress the stereotypy behaviors in Slitrk1-KD mice as well. Discussion & Conclusion Our study revealed that reducing striatal Sltirk1 expression induces stereotypic tic behaviors and alters endophenotypes in mice, indicating that Slitrk1-KD mice may serve as a novel animal model of TS, and whose tic behaviors can be rescued by PQs Compound 6 as well.

This study explored how alternate-day fasting (ADF), a type of intermittent fasting, a diet involving one day of eating and fasting, subsequently affects urinary system health in epileptic rats. Using a genetic rat model of epilepsy, we examined bladder and kidney function through tissue analysis, biochemical tests, and physiological assessments, focusing on differences between males and females. The results showed that epilepsy causes significant urinary system damage linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. However, ADF reduces this damage by lowering inflammation and restoring antioxidant balance. Male rats exhibited more oxidative damage, while female rats responded better to ADF, likely due to hormonal differences. These findings suggest ADF as a potential, cost-effective dietary approach to protect against urinary complications in epilepsy and similar conditions. Understanding these effects may lead to improved treatments for both genders and a better quality of life for people with chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an important role in the modulation of neuronal excitability, and a disruption of GABAergic transmission contributes to the pathogenesis of some seizure disorders. Although many currently available antiseizure medications do act at least in part by potentiating GABAergic transmission, there is an opportunity for further research aimed at developing more innovative GABA-targeting therapies. The present article summarises available evidence on a number of such treatments in clinical development. These can be broadly divided into three groups. The first group consists of positive allosteric modulators of GABAreceptors and includes Staccatoalprazolam (an already marketed benzodiazepine being repurposed in epilepsy as a potential rescue inhalation treatment for prolonged and repetitive seizures), the α2/3/5 subtype-selective agents darigabat and ENX-101, and the orally active neurosteroids ETX155 and LPCN 2101. A second group comprises two drugs already marketed for non-neurological indications, which could be repurposed as treatments for seizure disorders. These include bumetanide, a diuretic agent that has undergone clinical trials in phenobarbital-resistant neonatal seizures and for which the rationale for further development in this indication is under debate, and ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug currently investigated in a randomised double-blind trial in focal epilepsy. The last group comprises a series of highly innovative therapies, namely GABAergic interneurons (NRTX-001) delivered via stereotactic cerebral implantation as a treatment for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, an antisense oligonucleotide (STK-001) aimed at upregulating NaV1.1 currents and restoring the function of GABAergic interneurons, currently tested in a trial in patients with Dravet syndrome, and an adenoviral vector-based gene therapy (ETX-101) scheduled for investigation in Dravet syndrome. Another agent, a subcutaneously administered neuroactive peptide (NRP2945) that reportedly upregulates the expression of GABAreceptor α and β subunits is being investigated, with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other epilepsies as proposed indications. The diversity of the current pipeline underscores a strong interest in the GABA system as a target for new treatment development in epilepsy. To date, limited clinical data are available for these investigational treatments and further studies are required to assess their potential value in addressing unmet needs in epilepsy management.",

Based on field investigations at 117 survey sites of southwest China, a total of 2512 mites were collected from 55rats. Under a microscope, these mites were taxonomically identified as 56 distinct species, comprising 37 chigger mite species and 19 gamasid mite species.

Of the seven vector mite species,was one of dominant chigger species, with a higher infestation index on rats (= 21.82%,= 7.76) than the other six vector mite species. The sex ratio of female gamasid mites was higher than that of males. The number and infestation of adult gamasid mites were higher than those of immature mites. The infestation indexes of mites onhosts varied with the host's sex and age and fluctuated along different environmental gradients. The association coefficient () showed a slight positive association between chiggers and gamasid mites, suggesting that these two groups of mites may coexist onrats. Spearman correlation coefficients showed positive correlations among some dominant and vector mite species, indicating that some mite species tend to select the same hosts. A total of 69 mite species (47 chigger mite species and 22 gamasid mite species) onwere estimated by species rarefaction and extrapolation curves. In conclusion,has a high susceptibility to mite infestation, and it has the potential to harbor abundant mites, with heavy mite burdens.

Correspondingly, studies of this disease in nonhuman animals have brought forward an equally wide array of animal models, i.e. species and acute or chronic seizure induction protocols. Epilepsy research has a long history of comparative anatomical and physiological studies on a range of mostly mammalian species. Nonetheless, a relatively limited number of rodent models emerged as the primary choices for most epilepsy-related investigations. In many cases these animal models are selected based on convenience or tradition, though technical or experimental rationale does, and should, factor into these decisions. More complex mammalian brains and, especially, genetic model organisms including zebrafish have been studied less but offer significant advantages that are being widely recognized.",

      "abstract": "Wild chicory, or Hyoseris radiata L., is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, is a plant used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, blood depurative, and against kidney stones. The present study aimed to assess for the first time the acute and subacute toxicity, to quantify the total amount of polyphenols and flavonoids, and to assess the antioxidant activity of H. radiata collected from Setif, Algeria. The overall amount of flavonoids and polyphenols was quantified spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated according to two methods, DPPH and FRAP. The acute toxicity of H. radiata was carried out according to the OECD guideline 423 to determine the median lethal dose LD50 and the subacute toxicity was evaluated according to OECD guideline 407 to assess the possible pathological effects of the extract administered for 28 days by oral route. The results show that the total amount of polyphenols and flavonoids was 132.53 ± 2 µg of GAE·1 mg-1 and 96.11 ± 3.65 µg of QE·1 mg-1 of extract, respectively. The extract shows a good antioxidant potential in both tests. The administered dose (2 g·kg-1 of BW) didn’t produce any changes in general behaviors or mortality, so the LD50 is greater than 2 g·kg-1 of BW. Moreover, the daily administration of the extract with 2 doses, 100 mg·kg-1 and 200 mg·kg-1 didn’t cause any changes in body weight, behavior test, hematological parameters, and organ relative weight. A significant decrease in triglyceride was recorded in both concentrations. Based on the present findings, the extract of H. radiata has no significant toxicity. These findings offer valuable information about the toxicity profile of the traditional medicine plant Hyoseris radiata L.",

      "abstract": "Lactate fermentation, such as yogurt, is known to increase antioxidant activity. In addition to yogurt, fermentation can also be applied to herbal plants. Polyherbal plants Taxus sumatrana (Sumatran cypress), jixueteng (Spatholobus suberectus), and pearl grass (Hedyotis corymbosa) (TBR) contain total phenolic compounds that act as antioxidants and can lower cholesterol levels. This study aims to analyze the effect of TBR polyherbal fermentation on total phenol content and antioxidant activity. Polyherbal extraction is carried out by the maceration method using 96% ethanol for 24 hours. Total phenolic tests were carried out using gallic acid, followed by aerobic fermentation with lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus with 1%, 2%, and 3% TBR extract concentrations. Antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH method, and lipid profile tests were performed in vivo on 35 white rats (Rattus norvegicus), which were divided into 7 treatment groups. The results showed that TBR polyherbal fermentation significantly increased the total phenolic levels, with a concentration of 3% resulting in the highest levels (41.689 ± 0.5682% GAE). Although antioxidant activity decreased slightly after fermentation, it remained in the strong category (IC50 76.816–88.283 μg/mL). In vivo tests showed that polyherbal yogurt TBR 3% lowered triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and slightly increased HDL levels, but was less effective in lowering LDL. In conclusion, TBR polyherbal fermentation increases total phenolic levels while maintaining strong antioxidant activity, with potential as a natural source of antioxidants for lipid profile improvement.",

      "abstract": "Background/Purpose: The acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of a Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 has been demonstrated to reduce the total seizure duration and mean duration of seizures in male GAERS (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg). The purpose of this research is to determine the chronic use of five days will effect the spike-and-wave discharges (SWD) of absence epilepsy in female GAERS as well as to show if there is any difference in the expression of SWDs between female and male GAERS. \nMethods: Five female weighing about 150-350 grams, and male GAERS were used in experiments. Stereotaxic surgery was performed to insert EEG recording electrodes over the fronto-parietal cortices under anesthesia. Female GAERS were injected with the substance Y-27632 intraperitoneally over the course of five days rats, and compared to the baseline EEG of the same animals. In addition male and female GAERS baseline SWD characteristics were analyzed using EEG recordings and paired and unpaired t-tests were performed. \nResults: Total and mean SWD duration, and the number of SWDs did not significantly differ when applied to female GAERS. Although a trend of reduced total duration was observed in female rats it was not statistically significant. For the comparison of the mean duration and number of SWDs between the female and male GAERS, a significant difference was observed (p< 0.05). While the mean duration for SWDs is shorter in duration in females (t(8) = 3.23, p = 0.01), the number of SWDs were more in females in comparison to male GAERS (t(8) = 2.97, p = 0.02). \nConclusion: This study highlights the intricate relationship between gender, epilepsy, and pharmacological interventions. Although some outcomes did not reach statistical significance, trends suggest potential gender-related differences in SWD response to Y-27632 or SWD expression in general. The administration route may not be as effective in intraperitoneal route as in i.c.v. Further experiments can be performed by changing the route of administration.",

      "abstract": "Absence seizures are episodes of impaired consciousness and responsiveness that impact an individual's ability to interact with the world around them. Childhood absence epilepsy, a condition defined by these seizures, can have profound effects on children's social, educational, and psychological development. Absence seizures are accompanied by a distinctive electrographic signature called a spike-wave discharge. The impairment of consciousness associated with a spike-wave discharge can be variable: some people maintain responsiveness during some absence seizures, and some rodent oscillations resembling spike-wave discharges may not have any behavioral impact. We previously observed that spike-wave discharges in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg model sometimes terminated shortly after presentation of a conditioned auditory stimulus. In this study we found that these terminations were caused by the stimuli and that they occurred after approximately 50% of stimuli. We also found that the probability of a spike-wave discharge being interrupted depended on stimulus timing, degree of conditioning, and electrographic signal power. These data provide insight into the factors that determine the mechanisms of absence seizure termination, with possible implications for therapy.",

      "abstract": "For over four decades, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been recognized as a critical structure in the modulation of seizure activity. Pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition of the SNr produces robust seizure suppression in a range of seizure models. These findings have given rise to a longstanding, yet unresolved question: do seizures involve a failure of inhibition within the SNr? We recorded single-unit activity in the SNr during spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in male and female WAG/Rij rats, a model of genetic absence epilepsy. We monitored extracellular γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels using intensity-based GABA sensing fluorescence reporter (iGABASnFR). To emphasize the multi-modal efficacy of SNr inhibition on seizure suppression, we optogenetically inhibited the SNr. Fifty percent of recorded neurons exhibited a marked increase in firing at SWD onset, with activity returning to baseline at SWD termination. Extracellular GABA levels revealed a decrease in fluorescence during SWDs, consistent with reduced GABAergic transmission. Optogenetic inhibition of SNr neurons using continuous (open-loop) inhibition, but not closed-loop (responsive) inhibition, significantly reduced SWD incidence. These data suggest that a loss of GABAergic input to the SNr is associated with increased neuronal activity. Optogenetically restoring inhibition effectively reduced seizure burden. Together, these findings address a long-standing gap in the literature and provide compelling evidence that impaired inhibition within the SNr contributes to seizure expression.",

      "abstract": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is characterized by absence seizures, which are episodes of lack of consciousness accompanied by electrographic spike-wave discharges. About 60% of children and adolescents with absence seizures are affected by major neuropsychological comorbidities, including anxiety. Endocannabinoids and monoamines are likely involved in the pathophysiology of these CAE psychiatric comorbidities. Here, we show that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor type 1/2 (CB1/2R) agonist WIN 55,212-2 (2 mg/kg) has a strain-dependent effect on anxiety-like and motor behavior when assess in the hole board test and cerebral monoaminergic levels in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and their non-epileptic control (NEC) rat strain. Using quantitative and Temporal pattern (T-pattern) analyses, we found that WIN 55,212-2 did not affect the emotional status of GAERS, but it was anxiolytic in NEC. Conversely, WIN 55,212-2 had a sedative effect in GAERS but was ineffective in NEC. Moreover, vehicle-treated GAERS more motivated to explore by implementing more complex and articulated strategies. These behavioral changes correlate with the reduction of 5-HT in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN) and noradrenaline (NA) in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in vehicle-treated GAERS compared to NEC rats, which could contribute to their low anxiety status and hypermotility, respectively. On the other hand, the increased level of NA in the EPN and 5-HT in the SN is consistent with an activation of the basal ganglia output-mediated motor suppression observed in WIN 55,212-2-treated GAERS rats. These data support the view of a strain-dependent alteration of the endocannabinoid system in absence epilepsy by adding evidence of a lower emotional responsiveness and a basal ganglia hypersensitivity to cannabinoids in GAERS compared to NEC rats.",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to discuss how valproic acid improves nerve injury in young rats with epilepsy by regulating STXBP1. It also seeks to identify risk proteins for epilepsy through bioinformatics analysis. 30 young rats were divided into three groups, namely Normal, Model, and VA. Each group contained 10 rats. Epilepsy models were established in all groups except the control group. After modeling, the valproic acid group was orally administered 1 mg/kg of valproic acid. Cognitive function was assessed using the water maze experiment, while hippocampal tissue morphology was observed through Nissl staining. The neuronal apoptosis rate in hippocampal tissue was detected using the TUNEL method. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the NMDARl-positive cell rate in hippocampal tissue. Meanwhile, immunoblotting was used to measure the expression levels of STXBP1 and SLC2A1p proteins in hippocampal tissue. Bioinformatics analysis identified STXBP1 as a risk protein for epilepsy. Compared to the control group, the platform search time, neuronal apoptosis rate, NMDARl-positive cell rate, number of crossing platforms, and proportion of original platform search time in the model group of young mice decreased on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 (P&lt;0.001). In addition, the levels of STXBP1 and SLC2A1 proteins decreased (P&lt;0.001). In comparison to the model group, platform search time, neuronal apoptosis rate, and NMDAR1-positive cell rate in the valproic acid group of young mice decreased on days 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, the number of crossing platforms and the proportion of original platform search time increased (P&lt;0.001). In addition, the levels of STXBP1 and SLC2A1 proteins significantly increased (P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, valproic acid can significantly improve cognitive function, reduce the expression of NMDAR1, and inhibit neuronal apoptosis in juvenile epileptic rats.

      "abstract": "A mesoscale network model is proposed for the development of spike and wave discharges (SWDs) in the cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) circuit. It is based on experimental findings in two genetic models of childhood absence epilepsy-rats of WAG/Rij and GAERS strains. The model is organized hierarchically into two levels (brain structures and individual neurons) and composed of compartments for representation of somatosensory cortex, reticular and ventroposteriomedial thalamic nuclei. The cortex and the two thalamic compartments contain excitatory and inhibitory connections between four populations of neurons. Two connected subnetworks both including relevant parts of a C-T-C network responsible for SWD generation are modelled: a smaller subnetwork for the focal area in which the SWD generation can take place, and a larger subnetwork for surrounding areas which can be only passively involved into SWDs, but which is mostly responsible for normal brain activity. This assumption allows modeling of both normal and SWD activity as a dynamical system (no noise is necessary), providing reproducibility of results and allowing future analysis by means of theory of dynamical system theories. The model is able to reproduce most time-frequency changes in EEG activity accompanying the transition from normal to epileptiform activity and back. Three different mechanisms of SWD initiation reported previously in experimental studies were successfully reproduced in the model. The model incorporates also a separate mechanism for the maintenance of SWDs based on coupling analysis from experimental data. Finally, the model reproduces the possibility to stop ongoing SWDs with high frequency electrical stimulation, as described in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is a heritable human neurological disorder characterized by brief nonconvulsive seizures with behavioral arrest, moderate-to-severe loss of consciousness (absence), and distinct spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Genetic models of this disorder have been created by selectively inbreeding rats for absence seizure-like events with similar electrical and behavioral characteristics. However, these events are also common in outbred laboratory rats, raising concerns about whether SWD/immobility accurately reflects absence epilepsy as opposed to \"normal\" rodent behavior. We hypothesized that, if SWD/immobility models absence seizures, it would not exist in wild-caught rats due to the pressures of natural selection. To test this hypothesis, we compared chronic video/electrocorticogram recordings from male and female wild-caught (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats to recordings from laboratory outbred BN, outbred Long-Evans, and inbred WAG/Rij rats (i.e., a model of absence epilepsy). Wild-caught BN rats displayed absence-like SWD/immobility events that were highly similar to outbred BN rats in terms of spike-wave morphology, frequency, diurnal rhythmicity, associated immobility, and sensitivity to the anti-absence drug, ethosuximide; however, SWD bursts were less frequent and of shorter duration in wild-caught and outbred BN rats than the outbred Long-Evans and inbred WAG/Rij strains. We conclude that SWD/immobility in rats does not represent absence seizures, although they appear to have many similarities. In wild rats, SWD/immobility appears to represent normal brain activity that does not reduce survival in natural environments, a conclusion that logically extends to outbred laboratory rats and possibly to those that have been inbred to model absence epilepsy.Spike-wave discharges (SWDs), behavioral arrest, and diminished consciousness are cardinal signs of seizures in human absence epilepsy and are used to model this disorder in inbred rats. These characteristics, however, are routinely found in outbred laboratory rats, leading to debate on whether SWD/immobility is a valid model of absence seizures. The SWD/immobility events in wild-caught rats appear equivalent to those found in outbred and inbred rat strains, except for lower incidence and shorter durations. Our results indicate that the electrophysiological and behavioral characteristics of events underlying hypothetical absence epilepsy in rodent models are found in wild rats captured in their natural environment. Other criteria beyond observation of SWDs and associated immobility are required to objectively establish absence epilepsy in rat models.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a critical medical emergency marked by persistent or rapidly repeating seizures, posing a threat to life. Using the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE model, we decide to evaluate the anti-seizure effects of ivermectin as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAreceptor and the underlying mechanisms involved. Lithium chloride was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 127 mg/kg, followed by the administration of pilocarpine at a dose of 60 mg/kg after a 20-h interval in order to induce SE. Subsequently, the rats received varying amounts of ivermectin (0.3, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before the onset of SE. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms, we had pharmacological interventions of diazepam (1 mg/kg), glibenclamide and nicorandil as ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker and opener (both 1 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrexone and morphine, as opioid receptor antagonist and agonist (1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). In addition, three nitric oxide inhibitors, namely, L-NAME (10 mg/kg, i.p.), 7-NI (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg, i.p.), were administered to the rats in the experiment. Finally, we use ELISA and western blotting, respectively, to examine the amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), nitrite, and GABAreceptors in the rat hippocampal tissue. The study found that ivermectin, at doses of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg, exerts anti-seizure effects and decrease Racine's scale SE score. Interestingly glibenclamide and naltrexone reduced the anti-seizure effects of ivermectin, and from other hand diazepam, nicorandil, morphine, L-NAME, 7-NI, and aminoguanidine, enhance the effects when co-administrated with subeffective dose of ivermectin. Additionally, the study found that ivermectin decreased the elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-1β following SE, while increased the reduced expression of GABAreceptors. Overall, these findings suggest that ivermectin has anti-seizure effects in a SE seizure which may be mediated by the modulation of GABAergic, opioidergic, and nitrergic pathways and Kchannels.",

The use of EEG expands the preclinical research involving the long-term recording of neuro-activities in rodent models of epilepsy targeted towards the efficient testing of prospective antiseizure medications. Typically, trained epileptologists visually analyse long-term EEG recordings, which is time-consuming and subject to expert variability. Automated epileptiform discharge detection using machine learning or deep learning methods is an effective approach to tackling these challenges. This systematic review examined and summarised the last 30 years of research on detecting epileptiform discharge in rodent models of epilepsy using machine learning and deep learning methods. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on two databases, PubMed and Google Scholar. Following the PRISMA protocol, the 3021 retrieved articles were filtered to 21 based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. An additional article was obtained through the reference list. Hence, 22 articles were selected for critical analysis in this review. These articles revealed the seizure type, features and feature engineering, machine learning and deep learning methods, training methodologies, evaluation metrics so far explored, and models deployed for real-world validation. Although these studies have advanced the field of epilepsy research, the majority of the models are experimental. Further studies are required to fill in the identified gaps and expedite preclinical research in epilepsy, ultimately leading to translational research.",

We identified that treatment of the rpIC with a cocktail containing the GABAA receptor antagonist SR95531 and the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP35348 enhanced restraint-evoked tachycardia, whereas the same pharmacological approach in the cpIC decreased this response. Treatment of the rpIC with the nonselective ionotropic glutamate receptors antagonist kynurenic acid decreased the drop in tail skin temperature, and GABA receptor antagonism caused an opposite effect. Restraint increased Fos-positive cells in rpIC and cpIC, and local treatment with the glutamate receptor antagonism decreased this effect in both subregions. These data suggest a site-specific control of stress-evoked tachycardia by GABAergic mechanisms in the pIC. Moreover, sympathetically-mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction is specifically controlled by rpIC through opposite role of glutamatergic (facilitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurotransmissions.",

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy syndromes are part of the genetic generalized epilepsies, the pathogenesis of which remains poorly understood, although a polygenic architecture is presumed. Current focus on single molecule or gene identification to elucidate epileptogenic drivers is unable to fully capture the complex dysfunctional interactions occurring at a genetic/proteomic/metabolomic level. Here, we employ a multi-omic, network-based approach to characterize the molecular signature associated with absence epilepsy-like phenotype seen in a well validated rat model of genetic generalized epilepsy with absence seizures. Electroencephalographic and behavioral data was collected from Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS,= 6) and non-epileptic controls (NEC,= 6), followed by proteomic and metabolomic profiling of the cortical and thalamic tissue of rats from both groups. The general framework of weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify groups of highly correlated proteins and metabolites, which were then functionally annotated through joint pathway enrichment analysis. In both brain regions a large protein-metabolite module was found to be highly associated with the GAERS strain, absence seizures and associated anxiety and depressive-like phenotype. Quantitative pathway analysis indicated enrichment in oxidative pathways and a downregulation of the lysine degradation pathway in both brain regions. GSTM1 and ALDH2 were identified as central regulatory hubs of the seizure-associated module in the somatosensory cortex and thalamus, respectively. These enzymes are involved in lysine degradation and play important roles in maintaining oxidative balance. We conclude that the dysregulated pathways identified in the seizure-associated module may be involved in the aetiology and maintenance of absence seizure activity. This dysregulated activity could potentially be modulated by targeting one or both central regulatory hubs.",

In this study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neurodevelopmental consequences of gestational VPA exposure using integrative genomics. We assessed the effect of gestational VPA on foetal brain gene expression using a validated rat model of valproate teratogenicity that mimics the human scenario of chronic oral valproate treatment during pregnancy at doses that are therapeutically relevant to the treatment of epilepsy. Two different rat strains were studied-inbred Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg, a model of genetic generalized epilepsy, and inbred non-epileptic control rats. Female rats were fed standard chow or VPA mixed in standard chow for 2 weeks prior to conception and then mated with same-strain males. In the VPA-exposed rats maternal oral treatment was continued throughout pregnancy. Foetuses were extracted via C-section on gestational Day 21 (1 day prior to birth) and foetal brains were snap-frozen and genome-wide gene expression data generated. We found that gestational VPA exposure via chronic maternal oral dosing was associated with substantial drug-induced differential gene expression in the pup brains, including dysregulated splicing, and observed that this occurred in the absence of evidence for significant neuronal gain or loss. The functional consequences of VPA-induced gene expression were explored using pathway analysis and integration with genetic risk data for psychiatric disease and behavioural traits. The set of genes downregulated by VPA in the pup brains were significantly enriched for pathways related to neurodevelopment and synaptic function and significantly enriched for heritability to human intelligence, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our results provide a mechanistic link between chronic foetal VPA exposure and neurodevelopmental disability mediated by VPA-induced transcriptional dysregulation.",

Moringa oleifera root (MOR) contains bioactive compounds and antioxidants that may aid in weight reduction. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-obesity potentials of MOR in obese rats. Preliminary phytochemical screening including total phenolic content of MOR extract was done following standard procedures. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The toxicity of the extract was also assessed using the brine shrimp lethality test. For the anti-obesity activity evaluation, thirty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: normal control, negative control (distilled water), positive control (orlistat), MOR400 (400 mg/kg BW), and MOR200 (200 mg/kg BW). Obesity was induced in the rats by the administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) for seven weeks, followed by five weeks of treatment with MOR. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, as well as liver histopathology were also evaluated. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids in MOR, with total phenolic content of 54.1±2.80 mg GAE/g. MOR exhibited strong antioxidant activity (IC50 = 37.6±0.44 µg/mL) and weak toxicity (LC50 = 772.6±269.9 µg/mL). MOR extract significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced body weight, Lee index, and organ (liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and spleen) weights in obese rats. Additionally, MOR improved liver histoarchitecture in obese rats. These findings suggest that MOR has potential anti-obesity effects.

Electrophysiological recordings confirmed the presence of spike-wave discharges in young adult GAERS but not NEC rats. A series of behavioural tests designed to assess anxiety-like behaviour (elevated plus maze, open field, acoustic startle response) and cognition (Pavlovian conditioning and latent inhibition) was subsequently conducted on male and female offspring. Results showed that GAERS exhibited significantly higher anxiety-like behaviour, a characteristic reported previously. In addition, using two protocols that differed in shock intensity, we found that both sexes of GAERS displayed exaggerated cued and contextual Pavlovian fear conditioning and impaired fear extinction. Fear reinstatement to the conditioned stimuli following unsignalled footshocks did not differ between the strains. Male GAERS also showed impaired latent inhibition in a paradigm using Pavlovian fear conditioning, suggesting that they may have altered attention, particularly related to previously irrelevant stimuli in the environment. Neither the female GAERS nor NEC rats showed evidence of latent inhibition in our paradigm.

The animals were split into 3 sets: A, B, and C (5 rats/set). Set A was administrated in distilled water (control set). Gabapentin was administrated orally to both B and C sets at the doses 21.8 and 43.6 mg/kg, respectively. The dosing period was 30 days. The findings showed glomerular atrophy and changes in renal tissue in the B and C sets. Brain sections of   B and C sets showed necrotic and degenerative changes. The findings showed insignificant body and brain weight increases in B and C sets, while set B significantly decreased kidney weight. Biochemical analysis showed an insignificant increase in the urea and creatinine in both experimental sets. Both B and C sets showed insignificant increases in the cholinesterase enzyme activity in the brain. Immunohistochemical assessment of the kidney tissue showed positive and strong positive immunoreactivity of both caspases 3 and 8. Both B and C sets showed weakly positive and positive Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GAFP) immunoreactivity in the brain. It was obvious that gabapentin caused the induction of apoptosis in the kidney through the overexpression of caspases 3&8. The medication also induced various lesions in the brain, especially in the axons of the neurons. The severity of its effect depended on the given dose and duration of treatment.",

      "abstract": "It is now widely established that dopamine, despite its nature as a slowacting biogenic monoamine, modulates fast neurotransmitters such as GABA. However, the mechanism through which this occurs still needs to be fully elucidated. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is the primary regulator of dopamine homeostasis, controlling extracellular levels of dopamine as well as its storage in vesicles. Here, we took advantage of the availability of dopamine transporter knockout (DAT) rats, which provide a unique opportunity to investigate the response of the GABAergic system under hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system, a condition found in different disorders of the Central Nervous System. The expression levels of GABAergic markers have been evaluated by means of western blot in the whole homogenate, cytosolic fraction, and post-synaptic density of the striatum of male DATrats. We found a widespread down-regulation of GABAergic markers in the striatum of DATrats. Our data show that DA overactivity critically reorganizes the striatal GABAergic synapse in a way that GABA neurotransmission appears to be toned down. Such changes are equally distributed among proteins regulating GABA synthesis (GAD67), release (vGAT) and reuptake (GAT1, GAT3). It also involves the main subunits of GABA receptors (GABA-A α1, α2, β1; GABA-B R1), their anchoring proteins (Gephyrin) and adhesion molecules (Neuroligin-2). Taken together, such changes paint a picture showing a compromised integrity of the striatal GABAergic system under conditions of functional hyperdopaminergia, which may be of interest for several disorders of the central nervous system.",

Studies of models of absence epilepsy have shown that the seizures are associated with an excess of inhibitory neurotransmission in the thalamus. In the present study, we used light-microscopic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry to quantify the interneurons in the lateral geniculate (LGN), ventral posteromedial (VPM), and ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei, and compared the values from normal Wistar rats and genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). We found that in both Wistar rats and GAERS, the proportion of interneurons was significantly higher in the LGN than in the VPM and VPL. In the LGN of Wistar rats, 16.4% of the neurons were interneurons and in the GAERS, the value was 15.1%. In the VPM, the proportion of interneurons was 4.2% in Wistar and 14.9% in GAERS; in the VPL the values were 3.7% for Wistar and 11.1% for the GAERS. There was no significant difference between Wistar rats and the GAERS regarding the counts of interneurons in the LGN, whereas the VPM and VPL showed significantly higher counts in GAERS. Comparison of the mean areas of both relay cells and interneuronal profiles showed no significant differences between Wistar rats and GAERS. These findings show that in the VPL and the VPM there are relatively more GABAergic interneurons in GAERS than in Wistar rats. This may represent a compensatory response of the thalamocortical circuitry to the absence seizures or may be related to the production of absence seizures.",

We have developed an easy-to-use, reliable, computational tool for automated detection of electrographic seizures from prolonged EEG recordings in rodent models of epilepsy. We applied a novel method based on advanced time-frequency analysis that detects EEG episodes with excessive activity in certain frequency bands. The method uses an innovative technique of short-term spectral analysis, the Similar Basis Function algorithm. The method was applied for offline seizure detection from long-term EEG recordings from four spontaneously seizing, chronic epilepsy rat models: the fluid percussion injury (n = 5 rats, n = 49 seizures) and post-status epilepticus models (n = 119 rats, n = 993 seizures) of acquired epilepsy, and two genetic models of absence epilepsy, Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg and Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (n = 41 and 14 rats, n = 8733 and 825 seizures, respectively). Our comparative analysis revealed that the EEG amplitude spectra of these four rat models are remarkably similar during epileptiform activity and have a single expressed peak within the 17- to 25-Hz frequency range. Focusing on this band, our computer program detected all seizures in the 179 rats. A quick semiautomated user inspection of the EEGs for the period of each identified event allowed quick rejection of artifact events. The overall processing time for 12-day-long recordings varied from a few minutes (5-10) to 30 minutes, depending on the number of artifact events, which was strongly correlated with the signal quality of the raw EEG data. Our automated seizure detection tool provides high sensitivity, with acceptable specificity, for long- and short-term EEG recordings from both acquired and genetic chronic epilepsy rat models. This tool has the potential to improve the efficiency and rigor of preclinical research and therapy development using these models.",

To examine this hypothesis an original algorithm for automatically determining restarts was developed. To implement the algorithm the windowed fast Fourier transform with a Hann window was used. The method was to track the frequency consecutive drops on a skeleton constructed from a spectrogram in a selected frequency range (7–12 Hz). The method does not rely on changes in the amplitude of the oscillations, while most of the known methods clearly rely on an increase in power in certain spectral ranges. Discharge restarts were successfully detected and were found to be not different from initial starts in terms of main frequency dynamics. Restarts were diagnosed in about four less often than starts. The existence of restarts confirms that different factors are responsible for maintenance of long spike-wave discharges: some discharges are supported by the special maintenance mechanism, others are continuous chains of short discharges.",

      "abstract": "Rats are believed to communicate their emotional state by emitting two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations. The first is long '22-kHz' vocalizations (>300 ms, <32-kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states, and the second is short '50-kHz' calls (<150 ms, >32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here, we describe aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state - prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named '44-kHz' vocalizations, are long (>150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35-50-kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls can be separated from other vocalizations. We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming uniform groups of vocalizations (bouts). We also show that some of rats' responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, for example, heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation. We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.",

Many HCN channel blockers are available, but their role in ASs has been investigated only by localized brain injection or in in vitro model systems due to their limited brain availability. Here, we investigated the effect on ASs of orally administered ivabradine (an HCN channel blocker approved for the treatment of heart failure in humans) following injection of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor elacridar, which is known to increase penetration into the brain of drug substrates for this efflux transporter. The action of ivabradine was also tested following in vivo microinjection into the cortical initiation network (CIN) of the somatosensory cortex and in the thalamic ventrobasal nucleus (VB) as well as on cortical and thalamocortical neurons in brain slices. We used electroencephalographic recordings in freely moving Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERSs) to assess the action of oral administration of ivabradine, with and without elacridar, on ASs. Ivabradine was also microinjected into the CIN and VB of GAERSs in vivo and applied to Wistar CIN and GAERS VB slices while recording patch-clamped cortical Layer 5/6 and thalamocortical neurons, respectively. Oral administration of ivabradine markedly and dose-dependently reduced ASs. Ivabradine injection into CIN abolished ASs and elicited small-amplitude 4-7-Hz waves (without spikes), whereas in the VB it was less potent. Moreover, ivabradine applied to GAERS VB and Wistar CIN slices selectively decreased HCN channel-dependent properties of cortical Layer 5/6 pyramidal and thalamocortical neurons, respectively. These results provide the first demonstration of the antiabsence action of a systemically administered HCN channel blocker, indicating the potential of this class of drugs as a novel therapeutic avenue for ASs.",

      "abstract": "Seizure prediction is the grand challenge of epileptology. However, effort was devoted to prediction of focal seizures, while generalized seizures were regarded as stochastic events. Long-lasting local field potential (LFP) recordings containing several hundred generalized spike and wave discharges (SWDs), acquired at eight locations in the cortico-thalamic system of absence epileptic rats, were iteratively analyzed in all possible combinations of either two or three recording sites, by a wavelet-based algorithm, calculating the product of the wavelet-energy signaling increases in synchronicity. Sensitivity and false alarm rate of prediction were compared between various combinations, and wavelet spectra of true and false positive predictions were fed to a random forest machine learning algorithm to further differentiate between them. Wavelet analysis of intracortical and cortico-thalamic LFP traces showed a significantly smaller number of false alarms compared with intrathalamic combinations, while predictions based on recordings in Layers IV, V, and VI of the somatosensory-cortex significantly outreached all other combinations in terms of prediction sensitivity. In 24-h out-of-sample recordings of nine Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), containing diurnal fluctuations of SWD occurrence, classification of true and false positives by the trained random forest further reduced the false alarm rate by 71%, although at some trade-off between false alarms and sensitivity of prediction, as reflected in relatively low F1 score values. Results provide support for the cortical-focus theory of absence epilepsy and allow the conclusion that SWDs are predictable to some degree. The latter paves the way for the development of closed-loop SWD prediction-prevention systems. Suggestions for a possible translation to human data are outlined.",

In this context, the current study explored the in vitro antioxidant and in vivo hypoglycemic activity of biophenols and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from Vitis vinifera L. muscat and quebranta seeds from the Ica Valley, Peru. The total polyphenol content (TPC) of muscat (1.57±0.015 mg GAE/g) and quebranta (1.43±0.015 mg GAE/g) seeds was estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. In vitro antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH• free radical assay for muscat and quebranta (IC50: 38.60±0.624 µg/mL and 42.83±0.306 µg/mL, respectively) and by FRAP 0.79±0.030 μg TEAC/g for muscat and 0.61±0.038 μg TEAC/g for quebranta. After inducing experimental hyperglycemia with alloxane in Rattus norvegicus strain Holtzman, treatment was carried out for 7 days and glucose levels were measured at 1, 2 and 4 hours. At a dose of 500 mg/kg, orally, of biophenols/PUFA from muscat and quebranta seeds, a hypoglycemic effect was observed; whose results were verified with the Shapiro-Wilk test (p-value > α = 0.05), Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (p-value 0.0001 < α = 0.05), Student’s T with p-value < α = 0.05 at 1 hour for days 1 to 6, and p-value 0.999 > α = 0.05 for 2 and 4 hours on day 7, indicates a small probability of difference; in ANOVA results the mean difference is significant (p-value 0.0001 < α 0.05). The Pearson analysis found a strong correlation [0.50 ≤ (0.9530–0.9827) < 1.0] between glibenclamide/biophenols-PUFA glucose levels.

      "abstract": "To find potential biomarkers and related metabolic pathways based on metabonomics of rat joint tissue, the rats with stable collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model were taken as the research object. A rat rheumatoid arthritis model was established by injecting type II collagen. Treatment groups received oral doses of puerarin (40 mg/kg), puerarin-gadolinium (40 mg/kg), gadolinium chloride (40 mg/kg), or methotrexate (0.5 mg/kg), while control groups received saline. After 28 days, joint tissue metabolomics was analyzed using UPLC-MS (Shimadzu LC-30A and SCIEX TripleTOF 6600+), revealing significant metabolite changes and altered metabolic pathways. For the animal experiment part, based on observed changes in morphological, histopathological, and biochemical indicators, puerarin-Gd demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy, surpassing that of puerarin, gadolinium chloride, and the positive control group. For the metabolomics part, compared with the blank group, the number of significantly different metabolites in the model group was 238, and most of the expressions were upregulated. Compared with the model group, the number of significantly different metabolites in the puerarin-gadolinium treatment group was 165, but most of them were downregulated. The KEGG enrichment pathway showed that the differential metabolites enrichment pathways of the puerarin-gadolinium treatment group and model group were mainly: linoleic acid metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, retrograde endogenous cannabinoid signal transduction, and glycerol phosphate metabolism pathway. Puerarin-gadolinium has a good therapeutic effect on rheumatoid arthritis rats, and its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of ferroptosis and the regulation of lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the most commonly reported triggers for seizures in patients with epilepsy, although the mechanisms that mediate this effect are not established. The clinical evidence supporting this is derived from patients' subjective experience of stress, and how this influences their own seizures. Animal models can be used to explore this phenomenon in controlled environments, free from subjective bias. Here, we used genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy, to explore the influence of stress and stress hormones on spontaneous seizures. Adult male GAERS (n = 38) and nonepileptic control (NEC) rats (n = 4) were used. First, rats were subjected to 30-min restraint stress to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Next, we assessed the effects of 30-min noise stress, and cage tilt stress, on spike-wave discharge seizures in GAERS. We then performed pharmacological experiments to assess the direct effects of stress hormones on seizures, including corticosterone, metyrapone, and deoxycorticosterone. GAERS exhibited elevated baseline corticosterone levels, compared to NEC rats. Noise stress and cage tilt stress significantly enhanced seizure incidence (p < .05), but only during stress periods. Exogenous corticosterone administration also significantly increased seizure occurrence (p < .05). Metyrapone, an inhibitor of corticosterone synthesis, completely abolished seizures in GAERS, and seizures remained suppressed for >2 h. However, deoxycorticosterone, the precursor of corticosterone, increased seizures. These results suggest that GAERS exhibit elevations in stress hormones, and this may contribute to seizures. Inhibiting corticosterone synthesis with metyrapone prevents seizures in GAERS, and shows potential for repurposing this drug as a future antiseizure medication.",

We then assessed core diurnal clock gene expression of per1, cry1, clock, and bmal1. In the GAERS rats, all tissues exhibited significant changes in clock gene expression (P < 0.05) when compared to NEC. In the KASE rats, there were fewer effects of the epileptic condition in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, or small intestine (P > 0.05) compared with shams.

The aim of the present study was to investigate morphological changes, apoptosis and GABA localization in the testis tissue of genetic absence epilepsy rats. Testis tissues of GAERS and Wistar rats were processed for paraffin embedding and electron microscopy. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome and periodic acid-Schiff reaction. GABA immunohistochemistry was applied for determining the alterations in GABA levels. GABA immunoreactivity was observed in the seminiferous tubules and interstitial areas of both GAERS and Wistar rats. GABA immunoreactivity was found to be decreased in GAERS compared to Wistar group. Electron microscopic observations showed that GABA was present in manchette microtubules, sperm tail and neck at different phases of spermiogenesis. Qualitative observations revealed that testis tissues of GAERS showed reduced sperm in the seminiferous tubules compared to the Wistar controls. In conclusion, we demonstrated GABAergic system in the seminiferous tubules of control and GAERS rats, in parallel with the previous studies; and there were alterations in this system in GAERS. We suggest that these alterations in absence epilepsy may also affect the gonadal system, resulting decreased",

      "abstract": "Frequency properties of the EEG characteristics of different seizure types including absence seizures have been described for various rodent models of epilepsy. However, little attention has been paid to the frequency properties of individual spike-wave complexes (SWCs), the constituting elements characterizing the different generalized seizure types. Knowledge of their properties is not only important for understanding the mechanisms underlying seizure generation but also for the identification of epileptiform activity in various seizure types. Here, we compared the frequency properties of SWCs in different epilepsy models. A software package was designed and used for the extraction and frequency analysis of SWCs from long-term EEG of four spontaneously seizing, chronic epilepsy models: a post-status epilepticus model of temporal lobe epilepsy, a lateral fluid percussion injury model of post-traumatic epilepsy, and two genetic models of absence epilepsy-GAERS and rats of the WAG/Rij strain. The SWCs within the generalized seizures were separated into fast (three-phasic spike) and slow (mostly containing the wave) components. Eight animals from each model were used (32 recordings, 104 510 SWCs in total). A limitation of our study is that the recordings were hardware-filtered (high-pass), which could affect the frequency composition of the EEG. We found that the three-phasic spike component was similar in all animal models both in time and frequency domains, their amplitude spectra showed a single expressed peak at 18-20 Hz. The slow component showed a much larger variability across the rat models. Despite differences in the morphology of the epileptiform activity in different models, the frequency composition of the spike component of single SWCs is identical and does not depend on the particular epilepsy model. This fact may be used for the development of universal algorithms for seizure detection applicable to different rat models of epilepsy. There is a large variety between people with epilepsy regarding the clinical manifestations and the electroencephalographic (EEG) phenomena accompanying the epileptic seizures. Here, we show that one of the EEG signs of epilepsy, an epileptic spike, is universal, since it has the same shape and frequency characteristics in different animal models of generalized epilepsies, despite differences in recording sites and location.",

      "abstract": "The laboratory rat has been used for a long time as the model of choice in several biomedical disciplines. Numerous inbred strains have been isolated, displaying a wide range of phenotypes and providing many models of human traits and diseases. Rat genome mapping and genomics was considerably developed in the last decades. The availability of these resources has stimulated numerous studies aimed at discovering causal disease genes by positional identification. Numerous rat genes have now been identified that underlie monogenic or complex diseases and remarkably, these results have been translated to the human in a significant proportion of cases, leading to the identification of novel human disease susceptibility genes, helping in studying the mechanisms underlying the pathological abnormalities and also suggesting new therapeutic approaches. In addition, reverse genetic tools have been developed. Several genome-editing methods were introduced to generate targeted mutations in genes the function of which could be clarified in this manner [generally these are knockout mutations]. Furthermore, even when the human gene causing a disease had been identified without resorting to a rat model, mutated rat strains (in particular KO strains) were created to analyze the gene function and the disease pathogenesis. Today, over 350 rat genes have been identified as underlying diseases or playing a key role in critical biological processes that are altered in diseases, thereby providing a rich resource of disease models. This article is an update of the progress made in this research and provides the reader with an inventory of these disease genes, a significant number of which have similar effects in rat and humans.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of absence and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is rare in both humans and animal models. Consistent with this, rat models of absence epilepsy, including genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), are resistant to experimental temporal lobe epileptogenesis, in particular by amygdala kindling. Structures within the cortical-thalamocortical system are critically involved in the generation and maintenance of the electrographic spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) that characterize absence seizures. Using in vivo electrophysiologic recordings, this study investigated the role of thalamocortical circuitry in the generalization of amygdala-kindling induced seizures in the GAERS and the nonepileptic control (NEC) strain of Wistar rats. GAERS and NEC rats were implanted with a stimulating electrode in amygdala and stimulated at afterdischarge threshold twice daily to a maximum number of 30 stimulations. Thereafter extracellular single neuron recordings were performed in vivo under neuroleptanesthesia in the thalamocortical network. In NEC rats, amygdala kindling induced convulsive class V seizures and altered characteristics of neuronal activity in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), in particular decreased firing rates and increased burst firing patterns. Less marked changes were seen in other regions examined: the ventroposteromedial nucleus of thalamus (VPM), the CA3 region of the hippocampus, and the deep layers (V/VI) of the cortex. GAERS did not progress beyond class II seizures, with a matched number of kindling stimulations, and the thalamic neuronal firing alterations observed in NEC rats were not seen. These data suggest that the TRN plays an important role in kindling resistance in GAERS and is central to the control of secondary generalization of limbic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Absence Epilepsy, a subtype of genetic generealised epilepsy, is characterised by sudden and brief episodes of impaired consciousness. The Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are key proteins involved in regulating neuronal excitability. In conditions like anti-LGI1 encephalitis and anti-NMDAR encephalitis, autoantibodies target and disrupt these proteins, causing memory deficits, behavioural changes, sleep disturbances, and epileptic seizures. However, the roles of LGI1 and NMDAR dysfunction in the pathophysiology of absence of seizures remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of LGI1 and NMDAR antibodies on absence seizures using two experimental models: Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and a low-dose pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) model of absence seizures. IgG purified from the peripheral blood of healthy controls (HC IgG), and patients with anti-NMDAR, and anti-LGI1 encephalitis, was administered intracerebroventricularly into GAERS and Wistar rats every other day for 11 days. Before and after antibody administration, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to analyse spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in GAERS. In Wistar rats, after the completion of antibody infusions, PTZ was administered (35 mg/kg) on the 12 th day to induce absence seizures. The occurrence of PTZ-induced SWDs was quantified. NMDAR IgG significantly increased the duration and number of SWDs in GAERS compared to HC IgG. LGI1 IgG had no significant effect, suggesting a differential role of NMDAR and LGI1 antibodies in modulating SWD activity. Similarly, NMDAR IgG-treated Wistar rats showed increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced absence seizures, while LGI1 IgG did not cause significant changes in PTZ-induced SWDs. These results reveal a distinct pro-epileptogenic effect of NMDAR antibodies in both genetic and pharmacological models of absence epilepsy, while LGI1 antibodies appear to have a negligible effect. These findings suggest a specific role for NMDAR dysfunction in absence seizure pathophysiology and support further investigation into antibody-mediated seizure mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Absence seizures (petit mal seizures) are characterized by a brief loss of consciousness without loss of postural tone. The disease is diagnosed by an electroencephalogram (EEG) showing spike-wave discharges (SWD) caused by hypersynchronous thalamocortical (TC) oscillations. There has been an explosion of research highlighting the role of astrocytes in supporting and modulating neuronal activity. Despite established in vitro evidence, astrocytes' influence on the TC network remains to be elucidated in vivo in the absence epilepsy (AE). In this study, we investigated the role of astrocytes in the generation and modulation of SWDs. We hypothesize that disturbances in astrocytes' function may affect the pathomechanism of AE. To direct the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) rAAV8-GFAP-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP or to control the effect of surgical intervention, AAV-CaMKIIa-EYFP was injected into the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus of 18 animals. After four weeks following the injection, rats were stimulated using blue light (~473 nm) and, simultaneously, the electrophysiological activity of the frontal cortical neurons was recorded for three consecutive days. The animals were then perfused, and the brain tissue was analyzed by confocal microscopy. A significant increase in the duration of SWD without affecting the number of SWD in genetic absence epileptic rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) compared to control injections was observed. The duration of the SWD was increased from 12.50 ± 4.41 s to 17.44 ± 6.07 following optogenetic stimulation in GAERS. The excitation of the astrocytes in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG-Rij) did not change the duration of SWD; however, stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the number of SWD from 18.52 ± 11.46 bursts/30 min to 30.17 ± 18.43 bursts/30 min. Whereas in control injection, the duration and the number of SWDs were similar at pre- and poststimulus. Both the background and poststimulus average firing rates of the SWD in WAG-Rij were significantly higher than the firing recorded in GAERS. These findings suggest that VB astrocytes play a role in modulating the SWD generation in both rat models with distinct mechanisms and can present an essential target for the possible therapeutic approach for AE.",

      "abstract": "Momordica cochinchinensis L. Spreng (gac) is rich in carotenoids, yet its potential anti-obesity effects remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of gac aril carotenoid-rich extract (GACRE) on biochemical markers, adipose tissue characteristics organ histology and the expression of obesity-related genes (PPARγ, C/EBP and UCP1) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese Sprague Dawley rats. Thirty-two male rats were randomly assigned into four groups: G1 (normal diet, ND), G2 (HFD), G3 (HFD + GACRE 50 mg/kg) and G4 (HFD + GACRE 200 mg/kg) for eight weeks via oral gavage. Although GACRE supplementation did not significantly reduce body weight or adipose tissue mass, rats in the GACRE-200 group exhibited significantly lower levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), triglycerides, creatine kinase and fasting blood glucose (reductions of 32.17%, 22.16% and 31.30%, respectively). Both GACRE-treated groups showed a ~50% reduction in creatinine levels, with no notable changes in amylase, lipase, alanine transaminase (ALT) or bilirubin levels. Histological examination of liver tissues revealed micro-vesicular steatosis and sinusoidal changes in the GACRE-200 group. Gene expression analysis showed elevated PPARγ and UCP1 levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) compared to white adipose tissue (WAT), correlating with a higher BAT mass and enhanced thermogenic potential. These findings suggest that GACRE at 200 mg/kg exerts modest therapeutic effects against obesity-related metabolic disturbances, primarily mediated through BAT activation and adipogenic gene modulation.",

      "abstract": "During development, embryos and foetuses may be exposed to maternally ingested antiseizure medications (ASM), valproate and lamotrigine, essential in some patients to control their epilepsy symptoms. Often, the two drugs are co-administered to reduce required doses of valproate, a known potential teratogen. This study used Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg to evaluate transfer of valproate and lamotrigine across late gestation placenta and their entry into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of developing rats, in mono- and combination therapies. Animals at embryonic day (E) 19, postnatal day (P) 0, 4 and 21, and adults were administered valproate (30 mg/kg) or lamotrigine (6 mg/kg) with their respective [H]-tracers, either alone or in combination. In chronic experiments, females consumed valproate-containing diet from 2 weeks prior to mating until offspring were used at E19 and P0. Drugs were injected 30 min before blood, CSF and brain samples were collected from terminally anaesthetised animals. Radioactivity in samples was measured. In acute monotherapy brain entry of valproate was higher in foetal than postnatal animals, correlating with its plasma protein binding. Brain entry of lamotrigine was not age-dependent. Combination therapy enhanced entry of lamotrigine into the adult brain but had no effects on brain and CSF entry of valproate. Following chronic valproate exposure, placental transfer of valproate decreased in combination therapy; however, foetal brain entry increased. Results suggest that during pregnancy, the use of combination therapy of valproate and lamotrigine may mitigate overall foetal exposure to valproate but potential risks to foetal brain development are less clear.",

Our goal was to gain insights into the lung protective effects of the roots ofL. against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in rats, along with the possible mechanism(s). The outcomes revealed deliberate quantities of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of 156.2 ± 5.13 GAE/g and 179.45 ± 2.08 mg QE/g, respectively. Crude extract possesses a maximum inhibitory potential of 81.77% ± 0.62% for acetylcholinesterase against eserine. Acute oral toxicity study revealed LDbeyond 7 g/kg. Plant extract markedly restored LPS-induced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, histopathological alterations, and leukocyte infiltration in the lung. ELISA testing on BALF found that the plant extract efficiently reinstated superoxide dismutase, total anti-oxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, and total oxidative stress. qRT-PCR indicated a decline in the endotoxin-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, transcription factor, and downregulated antioxidant potential in extract-treated groups. Furthermore, 24 metabolites were identified and quantified via GC-MS. A molecular docking procedure was implemented on the bioactive metabolites that were identified to evaluate their potential for inhibiting AChE. In conclusion,roots mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress by improving redox signaling and NF-ĸβ (p65) pathways and can thus play a role in strategies for overcoming therapeutic challenges.",

The present study aimed to examine possible differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and synapse counts in the substantia nigra pars reticulata anterior (SNRa) and posterior (SNRp) regions between GAERS and Wistar rats receiving kindling stimulations. Animals in the kindling group either received six stimulations in the amygdala and had grade 2 seizures or they were kindled, having grade five seizures. Rats were decapitated one hour after the last stimulation. SNR regions were obtained after vibratome sectioning of the brain tissue. GABA immunoreactivity was detected by immunogold method and synapses were counted. Sections were observed by transmission electron microscope and analyzed by Image J program. GABA density in the SNRa region of fully kindled GAERS and Wistar groups increased significantly compared to that of their corresponding grade 2 groups. The number of synapses increased significantly in kindled and grade 2 GAERS groups, compared to kindled and grade 2 Wistar groups, respectively, in the SNRa region. GABA density in the SNRp region of kindled GAERS group increased significantly compared to that of GAERS grade 2 group. In the SNRp region, both kindled and grade 2 GAERS groups were found to have increased number of synapses compared to that of GAERS control group. We concluded that both SNRa and SNRp regions may be important in modulating resistance of GAERS to kindling stimulations.",

Pathophysiological contributions of Ca3.2 calcium channels to burst firing and absence seizures were assessed in vitro using acute brain slice electrophysiology and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in vivo using free-moving electrocorticography recordings. TRN neurons from GAERS display sustained oscillatory burst-firing that is both age- and frequency-dependent, occurring only in the frequencies overlapping with GAERS SWDs and correlating with the expression of a Ca3.2 mutation-sensitive splice variant. In vivo knock-down of Ca3.2 using direct thalamic injection of lipid nanoparticles containing Ca3.2 dicer small interfering (Dsi) RNA normalized TRN burst-firing, and in free-moving GAERS significantly shortened seizures.

Recent studies have shown the involvement of orexin system in epilepsy. Limited data is available about the possible role of orexins in the pathophysiology of absence seizures. This study aims to understand the role of orexinergic signaling through the orexin-type 2 receptor (OX2R) in the pathophysiology of absence epilepsy. The pharmacological effect of a selective OX2R agonist, YNT-185 on spike-and-wave-discharges (SWDs) and the OX2R receptor protein levels in the cortex and thalamus in adult GAERS were investigated. The effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) (100, 300, and 600 nmol/10 μL), intrathalamic (30 and 40 nmol/500 nL), and intracortical (40 nmol/500 nL) microinjections of YNT-185 on the duration and number of spontaneous SWDs were evaluated in adult GAERS. The percentage of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and spectral characteristics of background EEG were analyzed after the ICV application of 600 nmol YNT-185. The level of OX2R expression in the somatosensory cortex and projecting thalamic nuclei of adult GAERS were examined by Western blot and compared with the non-epileptic Wistar rats. We showed that ICV administration of YNT-185 suppressed the cumulative duration of SWDs in GAERS compared to the saline-administered control group ( < 0.05). However, intrathalamic and intracortical microinjections of YNT-185 did not show a significant effect on SWDs. ICV microinjections of YNT-185 affect sleep states by increasing the percentage of SWS and showed a significant treatment effect on the 1-4 Hz delta frequency band power during the 1-2 h post-injection period where YNT-185 significantly decreased the SWDs. OXR2 protein levels were significantly reduced in the cortex and thalamus of GAERS when compared to Wistar rats. This study investigated the efficacy of YNT-185 for the first time on absence epilepsy in GAERS and revealed a suppressive effect of OX2R agonist on SWDs as evidenced by the significantly reduced expression of OX2R in the cortex and thalamus. YNT-185 effect on SWDs could be attributed to its regulation of wake/sleep states. The results constitute a step toward understanding the effectiveness of orexin neuropeptides on absence seizures in GAERS and might be targeted by therapeutic intervention for absence epilepsy.",

Ultrasound-assisted extraction was performed to obtain an aqueous extract of C. caudatus leaves. Qualitative phytochemical screening was carried out to identify the presence of bioactive compounds. Male Wistar rats were allocated to the following experimental groups: non-diabetic, diabetic without treatment, and diabetic treated with glibenclamide or aqueous C. caudatus extract at concentrations of 25%, 50%, or 100%. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg alloxan. Random blood glucose and body weight were monitored before (Day 0) and after treatment (Days 3 and 7). There was a trend of weight loss in diabetic rats compared to non-diabetic rats, though the difference was not statistically significant. After 7 days of treatment, there was a comparable decrease in the blood glucose of diabetic rats treated with 50% or 100% of aqueous C. caudatus extract and those treated with glibenclamide. Qualitative phytochemical screening indicated the presence of steroid, saponin, phenol, and flavonoid compounds. The total phenolic content was 38.48 mg GAE/g and IC50 DPPH antioxidant activity was 375.64 ppm.

Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERS) were resistant to these kindling-induced firing changes in TRN neurons, and are also resistant to the progression of kindling. We investigated whether a homozygous, missense, single nucleotide mutation (R1584P) in the Ca3.2 T-type Cachannel gene, which has been correlated with the expression of absence seizures in GAERS, influenced kindling progression and TRN firing patterns. Double-crossed (GAERS vs NEC; F2) rats that were homozygous for the Ca3.2 mutation (PP) and those negative for the mutation (RR) were implanted with a stimulating electrode in the amygdala. Rats received a total of 30 kindling stimulations at their afterdischarge threshold current twice daily, and kindling progression was evaluated. Thereafter, the extracellular neuronal activity of TRN neurons was recorded in vivo under neuroleptanesthesia to investigate the influence of Ca3.2 mutation on TRN firing patterns. We found that the R1584P mutation did not affect kindling progression in F2 crosses (P = 0.78). However, it influenced kindling-induced neuronal firing of TRN neurons. After 30 stimulations, RR rats exhibited a lower firing rate and a higher percentage of burst firing compared to PP rats. The decrease in firing frequency was correlated with the increase in the amount of burst firing in RR rats (R = 0.497). Our findings suggest that mutation in Ca3.2 T-type Cachannels may play a role in the resistance to kindling-induced changes in TRN neurons to a low-frequency and high-percentage bursting pattern seen in association with the convulsive stages of amygdala kindling, but is not in itself enough to explain the resistance to kindling progression observed in GAERS.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a chronic severe psychiatric disorder. In a series of studies, the implication of the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) in anxiety has been evidenced. Further, the outcome of preclinical research suggests that different NO donors, including sodium nitroprusside (SNP), have expressed an anxiolytic profile revealed in animal models of anxiety. Regardless of this, it is not yet clarified the mechanism(s) of action by which SNP induces its beneficial effects on anxiety. In this context, it has been hypothesized that these effects might be attributed to a potential interaction of this NO donor with the GABA type A and the 5-HTserotonergic receptors. The current study was designed to investigate this issue in the male rat. To this end, the light/dark box and the open field tests were utilized. SNP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) applied acutely induced an anti-anxiety-like effect evidenced either in the light/dark box or in the open field test. Either the GABAreceptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or the 5-HTserotonin receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed the above reported anxiolytic effects of SNP. The results here reported propose a functional interaction between SNP with the GABAergic and the serotonergic systems on anxiety and thus, might offer a plausible explanation for SNP's anxiolytic effects.",

Studies of models of absence epilepsy have shown that the seizures are associated with an excess of inhibitory neurotransmission in the thalamus. In the present study, we used light-microscopic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry to quantify the interneurons in the lateral geniculate (LGN), ventral posteromedial (VPM), and ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei, and compared the values from normal Wistar rats and genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). We found that in both Wistar rats and GAERS, the proportion of interneurons was significantly higher in the LGN than in the VPM and VPL. In the LGN of Wistar rats, 16.4% of the neurons were interneurons and in the GAERS, the value was 15.1%. In the VPM, the proportion of interneurons was 4.2% in Wistar and 14.9% in GAERS; in the VPL the values were 3.7% for Wistar and 11.1% for the GAERS. There was no significant difference between Wistar rats and the GAERS regarding the counts of interneurons in the LGN, whereas the VPM and VPL showed significantly higher counts in GAERS. Comparison of the mean areas of both relay cells and interneuronal profiles showed no significant differences between Wistar rats and GAERS. These findings show that in the VPL and the VPM there are relatively more GABAergic interneurons in GAERS than in Wistar rats. This may represent a compensatory response of the thalamocortical circuitry to the absence seizures or may be related to the production of absence seizures.",

Our objective was to investigate the antihyperuricemic activity of the natural product fromL. in vivo. The extract was obtained through the maceration offruits using an ethanolic solvent and was tested for its antihyperuricemic activity against potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats. Serum uric acid, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed before and after the treatment. Expression of urate transporter 1 (URAT1) was also measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Antioxidant activity based on a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay, along with total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC), were measured. Herein, we present the evidence of the serum uric acid lowering effect of thefruit extract along with improved AST and ALT (< 0.01). The reduction of serum uric acid was in accordance with the decreasing trend of URAT1 (1.02 ± 0.05-fold change in the 200 mg group), except in a group treated with 400 mg/kg body weight extract.

Pedroza: None. C.M. Fajardo: None. M. Pimentel: None. R. Mathur: None. We have previously demonstrated that Rothia mucilaginosa, a Gram-positive bacterium commonly found in the human duodenum, produces testosterone in vitro. Furthermore, female rats gavaged with R. mucilaginosa developed metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance, independent of weight gain. Here, we attempt to prove Koch’s postulates and reverse the metabolic effects of R. mucilaginosa in female rats. Methods: Reproductive age female rats were gavaged with 108 CFU/mL R. mucilaginosa or PBS (controls) daily for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, half of the R. mucilaginosa gavaged rats and half of the control rats were euthanized. All remaining rats were gavaged with PBS alone for another 4 weeks, followed by euthanasia. Rats were weighed and fasting serum was collected at each euthanasia. Fasting insulin and glucose were measured by ELISA, and HOMA-IR index was calculated. Results: After the initial 4-week gavage period, there was no significant difference in body weight between R. mucilaginosa gavaged rats (n=40, 227.40±10.71g ) and controls (n=40, 233.00±14.08g, P=0.17). R. mucilaginosa gavaged rats exhibited higher levels of fasting glucose (99.70±12.67 mg/dL vs. 89.17±15.73 mg/dL, P=0.0019) and fasting insulin (2.95±1.77 μIU/mL vs. 2.14±1.26 μIU/mL, P=0.025), and resulting higher HOMA-IR index (0.73±0.46 vs. 0.48±0.34, P=0.01), when compared to controls. 4 weeks after the last gavage with R. mucilaginosa, body weights remained similar in rats originally gavaged with R. mucilaginosa (n=20, 246.00±12.43g) and controls (n=20, 251.80±14.99g, P=0.19). At this timepoint, there were no significant differences between groups for fasting glucose levels (110.30±12.79 mg/dL vs. 106.60±10.25 mg/dL, P=0.32), fasting insulin levels (5.66±3.03 μIU/mL vs. 4.82±2.57 μIU/mL, P=0.36), or HOMA-IR index (1.57±0.93 vs. 1.28±0.71, P=0.29). Conclusion: Here we show that daily gavage with the Gram-positive duodenal bacterium R. mucilaginosa can induce metabolic consequences in rats, including higher fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index. These effects are reversed following cessation of gavage with R. mucilaginosa. Presentation: Monday, July 14, 2025",

Therefore, we investigated the outcomes of the specific antagonism of αARs on the spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERSs), together with its influence on the behavior and second messenger systems, which may point to the mechanisms to which a possible SWD modulation can be related. Atipamezole, an αAR antagonist, was administered intracerebroventricularly to the adult GAERSs, and electroencephalography (EEG) was conducted. The cumulative duration and number of SWDs, and the mean duration of each SWD complex were counted. The relative power of the EEG frequency bands and behavioral activity after the acute application of two doses (12 and 31 μg/5 μL) of atipamezole were evaluated. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) were measured in the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus of naive Wistar rats and GAERSs, administered with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) as a vehicle, or either acute or chronic atipamezole (12 μg), the latter being administered for 5 consecutive days. Atipamezole significantly suppressed SWDs dose-dependently, without affecting the relative power values of EEG frequency spectrum. The stereotypic activity was significantly lower in both naive Wistar rats and GAERSs receiving the highest dose (31 μg) of atipamezole compared to GAERSs receiving aCSF. In GAERSs, CaMKII levels were found to be higher in the thalamus after the acute and chronic application of SWD-suppressing doses of atipamezole (12 and 31 μg) compared to aCSF. This study emphasizes the αAR-related modulation of absence epilepsy and particularly the significance of αAR antagonism in suppressing SWDs. Atipamezole's SWD-suppressive actions may be through CaMKII-mediated second messenger systems in the thalamus.",

Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., frequently referred to as ‘pegaga’, is a plant renowned for its notable medicinal attributes. The primary aim of this study is to assess the antioxidant capacity and hepatoprotective activity of the ethanolic extract of C. asiatica (EECA). The assessments used to evaluate EECA for its antioxidant properties included total phenolic content (TPC), as well as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power assays. Additionally, the study evaluated the ability of EECA to mitigate experimentally induced hepatic injury in Sprague-Dawley rats caused by carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) at 100, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg b.wt. doses. Biochemical assays included measuring hepatic marker enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in serum, as well as evaluating malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in liver homogenates. The TPC of EECA was 106.55 ± 2.23 mg GAE/g. Its DPPH and reducing power assays exhibited moderately potent antioxidant attributes compared to standard references. Nonetheless, groups subjected to CCl₄ displayed notably elevated levels of ALT and AST, increased MDA, and decreased GSH. Pretreatment with EECA resulted in a marginal decrease in hepatic marker enzyme activity, with reductions in ALT (14% to 2-fold), AST (25% to 3-fold), and MDA (15–57%), along with an increase in GSH (3–23%). These findings imply that EECA contains active constituents capable of mitigating the hepatotoxic effects induced by CCl₄.",

There are numerous reports of Curcuma caesia, sometimes referred to as kali haldi in Hindi, being utilized as a treatment for a variety of illnesses. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of a flavonoid-rich extract of the entire Curcuma caesia plant to mitigate the hepatotoxic effects of paracetamol on mice. Total phenolics were determined using phytochemical screening and extraction in a variety of solvents. The aqueous extract of Curcuma caesia was utilized to investigate the preventive effect on hepatic damage caused by paracetamol. 7.97%w/v of the aqueous extract and 12.36%w/v of the methanol extract were produced. The aqueous extract was found to contain alkaloids, glycosides, phenolics, flavonoids, carbohydrates, saponins, sterol, and terpenes, according to the phytochemical screen. It was discovered that the methanolic and aqueous extracts had total phenolic contents of 63.17 and 78.54 GAE mg/g of dry extract, respectively. In contrast to the group that received PCM, the biochemical analysis unequivocally shows that the hepatic cells in the group treated with an aqueous extract of Curcuma caesia  (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) are normal. Because it may restore the liver function that has been damaged by PCM, the aqueous extract of Curcuma caesia can be regarded as an effective hepatoprotective in nature.

Previously, we showed that neonatal tactile stimulations produce disease-modifying effect on genetically determined absence epilepsy and associated depression in Wag/Rij rats. The study presented here examined the effect of TS during late ontogenesis (adolescence and young adulthood) on epilepsy and depression outcomes in this genetically epileptic rat strain. On postnatal day (PND) 38, male WAG/Rij rats randomly were assigned to either the tactile stimulation (TS), handled or control group (unhandled) with 8 animals in each group. Following a 7-day adaptation period to their new surroundings, the animals were submitted to tactile stimulation from PND 45 to PND 90, five days per week, for 5 min daily. The tactile-stimulated rat was removed from its cage, placed on the experimenter's lap, and had its neck and back gently stroked by the researcher. The handled rats were taken to another cage and left alone for 5 min daily from PND 45 to PND 90. The control rats were left undisturbed in their home cage, except for regular cage cleaning. After PND 90, all rats were left undisturbed until behavioral testing and EEG recording. When the animals were 7 months old, they were subjected to the sucrose consumption test (SCT) and the forced swimming test (FST). Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were made at 8 months of age in order to measure electroencephalographic seizure activity, thus, the spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Tactile-stimulated rats showed increased sucrose consumption and number of approaches to the sucrose solution in the SCT when compared with the handled and control rats. In the FST, rats in TS group showed lower immobility time and greater immobility latency, active swimming time and diving frequency than the handled and control rats. The duration and the number of seizures were not different amongst the groups. The data obtained suggest that TS in young rats is able to prevent depression in WAG/Rij rats.",

      "abstract": "Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) show a resistance to secondary generalization of focal limbic seizures evoked by kindling. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) is involved in the propagation and modulation of seizures in kindling. We first examined the role of the SNRanterior and SNRposterior subregions in the resistance to the development of kindling in GAERS. Subsequently, to determine whether kindling resistance relates to differential sensitivity of γ-aminobutyric acid γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic or dopaminergic SNR neurons to kindling, we studied the effects of kindling-inducing stimulations on parvalbumin (PRV; GABAergic neuron marker) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; dopaminergic neuron marker) immunoreactivity (ir), respectively, in GAERS and in nonepileptic control (NEC) Wistar rats that lack kindling resistance. Adult male GAERS were implanted with a stimulation electrode in the amygdala, and bilateral injection cannulas for lidocaine or saline injection (30 min before each kindling stimulation until the animals reached three stage 5 seizures or the 22 stimulations) into the SNRanterior or SNRposterior . In another experiment, PRV-ir in SNRanterior and SNRposterior and TH-ir in SNRposterior only were densitometrically compared in GAERS-SHAM, NEC-SHAM GAERS-STIM, and NEC-STIM animals (6 kindling stimulations). Bilateral SNRposterior infusions of lidocaine eliminated the kindling resistance and resulted in stage 5 generalized motor seizures in all kindled rats. Bilateral lidocaine infusions in the SNRanterior failed to alter the kindling resistance in GAERS. PRV-ir in the SNRposterior was unaltered in GAERS-STIM but increased in NEC-STIM group. Cellular TH-ir in the SNRposterior significantly increased by kindling stimulations in both NEC-STIM and GAERS-STIM groups. The kindling resistance in GAERS is mediated by the SNRposterior in a lidocaine-sensitive manner. The insensitivity to kindling stimulation of PRV-ir in SNRposterior of GAERS but not NEC rats, implicate GABAergic SNRposterior neurons in kindling resistance. In contrast, the observed stimulation-specific increase in TH-ir in the SNRposterior is unrelated to kindling resistance.",

      "abstract": "Hispidulin (6-methoxy-4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid commonly found in various plant products, including the leaves of Clerodendrum inerme (L.) Gaertn (CI). While there's an abundance of literature describing the therapeutic effect of hispidulin and CI in oncological, immunological, and dermatological models, their effect on neuropsychiatric disorders is also of research interest. The previous reports on the neuroprotective and GABAreceptor positive modulatory effect of hispidulin may render it as a possible novel candidate as an antimigraine agent. In the present study, we employed the intracisternal instillation of capsaicin in anesthetized rats to induce the activation of trigeminovascular system (TGVS), which mimics the histopathological hallmarks of migraine that include increased neuronal activation in the trigeminal cervical complex (TCC), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and CGRP depletion in the dura mater. Administration of hispidulin (4, 10, and 50 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced all three TGVS activation parameters induced by i.c. capsaicin. However, pre-treatment of a selective antagonist for α6 subunit-containing GABAreceptor, furosemide (20 mg/kg, i.p.), did not significantly reverse the antimigraine effect of hispidulin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on hispidulin's suppressive effect on preclinical model of migraine. Further studies are required to explore the mechanism(s) of the antimigraine effect of hispidulin. However, these findings could potentially guide future clinical studies of hispidulin, with the aim of improving human health.",

We therefore sought to determine the in vivo effects of NPY on neuronal firing in the cortico-thalamo-cortical network activity, known to play a critical role in the generation of SWDs in these rats. NPY was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or in separate experiments locally on the neurons of caudal thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT) by use of juxtacellular iontophoresis in triple-barrel electrodes in male GAERS aged 12-15 weeks, in vivo under neuroleptic anesthesia. Drug infusions and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring were performed simultaneously with juxtacellular single neuronal recordings. Effect of NPY on electrically induced SWD induction threshold were also measured. NPY administration ICV led to a decrease in the total length of SWDs in EEG recordings. Both ICV administration and iontophoresis of NPY on NRT neurons led to an increase in interictal neuronal firing of NRT neurons. During ictal periods, ICV NPY administration reduced the number of thalamic action potentials per SWDs, as well as reduced waveform correlations between field potentials within the NRT and the cortical EEG. NPY administration ICV did not significantly alter the firing patterns of relay thalamic neurons interictally and cortical neurons during ictal and interictal periods. In addition, SWD induction threshold in the S2 region of the cortex was significantly increased after NPY administration. Our results show alterations in cortico-thalamo-cortical local and network properties following ICV administration of NPY, suggesting mechanisms of SWD suppression in GAERS. Cellular and network alteration of NRT activity, resulting from a direct action of NPY, may be a contributor to this effect.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Skin aging is a biological process that cannot be avoided. Repeated UVB exposure increases collagen degradation by increasing MMP-9 levels. Little is known about TIMP-1's potential role in skin protection or recovery from skin damage caused by photoaging. Sugar apple leaf extract increases cell proliferation, levels and collagen deposition. This study aims to determine the topical application of sugar apple leaf cream extract (Annona squamosa L.) to increase TIMP-1 levels and decrease MMP-9 levels in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) exposed to UVB light.\nMethods: Experimental study with a post-test-only design with a control group design using 35 male Wistar rats. There were five groups: negative control, positive control, and treatment (5%, 10%, and 20% sugar apple leaf extract cream). Skin biopsies were taken to measure TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels using the ELISA method. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS 25.0 application.\nResults: The phytochemical test showed total flavonoid levels of 3583.77 mg QE/100 mL, phenol 5244.98 mg GAE/100 mL, IC50 value 226.53 ppm, and alkaloids. The highest mean TIMP-1 level in the treatment group was 38.95 ± 3.31 ng/mL, and the lowest mean MMP-9 level was 2.94 ± 1.66 ng/mL (20% concentration). One Way ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels between the test groups with a p<0.001. Post hoc LSD analysis showed significantly higher TIMP-1 and lower MMP-9 levels (p<0.05) than the control.\nConclusion: Administration of sugar apple leaf cream extract increased TIMP-1 levels and significantly decreased MMP-9 levels in Wistar rats exposed to UVB light.\n \nPendahuluan: Penuaan kulit merupakan proses biologis yang tidak dapat dihindari. Paparan UVB berulang meningkatkan degradasi kolagen dengan meningkatkan kadar MMP-9. Potensi keterlibatan TIMP-1 dalam perlindungan kulit atau pemulihan dari adanya kerusakan kulit akibat photoaging masih belum banyak diketahui. Ekstrak daun srikaya diketahui dapat meningkatkan proliferasi sel, kadar dan deposisi kolagen. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui aplikasi topikal ekstrak krim daun srikaya (Annona squamosa L.) dalam meningkatkan kadar TIMP-1 dan menurunkan kadar MMP-9 pada tikus wistar (Rattus norvegicus) yang terpapar sinar UVB.\nMetode: Penelitian eksperimental dengan rancangan post-test-only with control group design ini menggunakan 35 tikus wistar jantan. Terdapat lima kelompok, yaitu kontrol negatif, kontrol positif, dan perlakuan (krim ekstrak daun srikaya 5%, 10%, dan 20%). Biopsi kulit diambil untuk pengukuran kadar TIMP-1 dan MMP-9 dengan metode ELISA. Analisis data dilakukan dengan menggunakan aplikasi SPSS 25.0.\nHasil: Uji fitokimia menunjukkan kadar total flavonoid sebanyak 3583,77 mg QE/100 mL; fenol 5244,98 mg GAE/100 mL, nilai IC50 226,53 ppm, dan alkaloid positif. Rerata kadar TIMP-1 tertinggi pada kelompok perlakuan adalah 38,95 ± 3,31 ng/mL dan rerata kadar MMP-9 terendah yaitu 2,94 ± 1,66 ng/mL (konsentrasi 20%).

We evaluated [Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and biomarkers as noninvasive assessments of renal fibrosis (RF) in CKD rats to generate new ideas for clinical diagnosis. A rat model of renal fibrosis was administered adenine by gavage (= 28), and the control group was given 0.9% NaCl by gavage (= 20). At different time points (weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6), five rats were randomly selected from the two groups for [Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 small animal PET/CT imaging. At the same time, the expression of Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in renal tissue and the expression levels of type III procollagen N-terminal peptide (PIIINP), transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), Klotho, and sex-determining region Y-box protein 9 (SOX9) in blood and urine were determined. FAP was highly expressed in the renal tissue of rats in the CKD group and expression increased with the progression of renal fibrosis. [Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 small animal PET/CT examination showed that the uptake of radioactive tracers in the CKD group was higher than that in the control group, and SUVmax (= 0.9405) and target-to-background ratio (TBR) (= 0.9392) were positively correlated with renal fibrosis. The serum levels of PIIINP, TGF-β1, and SOX9 in CKD rats were significantly higher than those in the control group and were positively correlated with RF (= 0.8234,= 0.7733, and= 0.7135, respectively) and SUVmax (= 0.8412,= 0.7763, and= 0.6814, respectively). Compared with the control group, the level of serum Klotho decreased and was negatively correlated with RF (= -0.6925) and SUVmax (= -0.6322). Compared with the control group, the levels of PIIINP and TGF-β1 in urine were positively correlated with RF (= 0.8127 and= 0.8077, respectively) and SUVmax (= 0.8400 and= 0.8177, respectively). Urine Klotho decreased compared with the control group and was negatively correlated with RF (= -0.5919) and SUVmax (= -0.5995). The change in urine SOX9 was not statistically significant. In conclusion, compared with renal biopsy, [Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 small animal PET/CT shows renal fibrosis quickly and noninvasively. PIIINP, TGF-β1, and Klotho in serum and urine may be used as biomarkers of RF, and serum SOX9 is expected to become a new diagnostic biomarker of RF.",

      "abstract": "Research into genetic and physiological mechanisms of widespread disorders such as arterial hypertension as well as neuropsychiatric and other human diseases is urgently needed in academic and practical medicine and in the field of biology. Nevertheless, such studies have many limitations and pose difficulties that can be overcome by using animal models. To date, for the purposes of creating animal models of human pathologies, several approaches have been used: pharmacological/chemical intervention; surgical procedures; genetic technologies for creating transgenic animals, knockouts, or knockdowns; and breeding. Although some of these approaches are good for certain research aims, they have many drawbacks, the greatest being a strong perturbation (in a biological system) that, along with the expected effect, exerts side effects in the study. Therefore, for investigating the pathogenesis of a disease, models obtained using genetic selection for a target trait are of high value as this approach allows for the creation of a model with a \"natural\" manifestation of the pathology. In this review, three rat models are described: ISIAH rats (arterial hypertension), GC rats (catatonia), and PM rats (audiogenic epilepsy), which are developed by breeding in the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences).",

Component analysis revealed that OFB contained bioactive substances including proteins (1.19 g/L), taurine (0.76 g/L), organic acids (2.30 mg/mL), polyphenols (123.00 mg GAE/L), flavonoids (1.97 mg RE/L), and zinc (1.10 mg/L). In vitro study revealed that OFB exhibited notable antioxidant activity, with a total antioxidant capacity of 1.28 U/mL, and DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl radical scavenging rates of 55.80%, 69.54%, and 48.36%, respectively. Animal experiments showed that, compared with the TG-induced model group, rats administered both low-dose (5 mL/kg) and high-dose (10 mL/kg) OFB showed significantly increased testis and seminal vesicle + prostate indices, sperm count, and serum testosterone (T) levels and decreased sperm malformation rate (< 0.01 for all). Histological analysis of the testis revealed an increased number of spermatogenic cells and sperm within the seminiferous tubules, along with ameliorated pathological conditions compared to the model group. Potential mechanisms might be related to OFB increasing the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) enzymes and reducing levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in testis (< 0.01). The findings demonstrated that OFB successfully alleviated TG-induced reproductive damage in male rats, which might be attributed to its excellent antioxidant effect. The study offers valuable insights for producing functional foods from oysters and further validates OFB's efficacy in promoting reproductive function.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physical, chemical, and sensory properties of yogurt that had been enriched with mango and potato peel powder at levels 1, 2, and 3%. The results demonstrated that fortifying yogurt with 3% potato and mango peel significantly enhanced its nutritional and functional qualities, as total solids increased from 13.34% in the control yogurt to 15.14 and 15.84% in the potato and mango peel-fortified versions, respectively. Protein content also rose from 3.78 to 3.94 and 4.05%, while ash levels improved from 0.78 to 0.90 and 0.98%. Additionally, fiber, which was absent in the control, reached 0.47 and 0.20% in the potato and mango peel-fortified yogurt, respectively. This fortification also led to a sharp increase in phenolic content, from 40.60 mg GAE/g in the control to 53.70 and 65.90 mg GAE/g, alongside a notable improvement in antioxidant activity, which increased from 20.60 to 33.50 and 40.80%. Together, these findings highlight the substantial positive impact of fortification on both nutritional composition and potential health benefits of yogurt. The strongest sensory features were seen in yogurt containing 2% mango and potato peel powder with a total score of 93.0 when compared to other treatments. In addition, the 2% mango and potato peel powder-fortified yogurt was tested as a hypercholesterolemia inhibitor in obese rats. Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. The first group served as the healthy control group, while Groups 2 through 5 were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for the duration of the experiment and given 10 g/day of various types of yogurt: yogurt with 2% mango powder and 2% potato peel powder as a treatment. The findings revealed a considerable reduction in LDL, cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, creatinine, and urea levels as compared to the positive control group, combined with a marked rise in HDL and total protein levels. According to the findings, yogurt, mango, and potato peel powder help liver and kidney functions in hyperlipidemic rats.

      "abstract": "Insulin-mediated signalling in the brain is critical for neuronal functioning. Insulin resistance is implicated in the development of some neurological diseases, although changes associated with absence epilepsy have not been established yet. Therefore, we examined the major components of PI3K/Akt-mediated insulin signalling in cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal tissues collected from Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) rats. Insulin levels were also measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For the brain samples, the nuclear fraction (NF) and total homogenate (TH) were isolated and investigated for insulin signalling markers including insulin receptor beta (IRβ), IR substrate-1 and 2 (IRS1 & 2), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase phospho-85 alpha (PI3K p85α), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, protein kinase B (PKB/Akt1/2/3), glucose transporter-1 and 4 (GLUT1 & 4) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) using western blotting. A significant increase in PTEN and GSK3β levels and decreased PI3K p85α and pAkt1/2/3 levels were observed in NF of GAERS cortical and hippocampal tissues. IRβ, IRS1, GLUT1, and GLUT4 levels were significantly decreased in hippocampal TH of GAERS compared to NEC. A non-significant increase in insulin levels was observed in plasma and CSF of GAERS rats. An insulin sensitivity assay showed decreased p-Akt level in cortical and hippocampal tissues. Together, altered hippocampal insulin signalling was more prominent in NF and TH compared to cortical and thalamic regions in GAERS. Restoring insulin signalling may improve the pathophysiology displayed by GAERS, including the spike-and-wave discharges that relate to absence seizures in patients.",

      "abstract": "Resting state-fMRI was performed to explore brain networks in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg and in nonepileptic controls (NEC) during monitoring of the brain state by simultaneous optical Ca-recordings. Graph theoretical analysis allowed for the identification of acute and chronic network changes and revealed preserved small world topology before and after seizure onset. The most prominent acute change in network organization during seizures was the segregation of cortical regions from the remaining brain. Stronger connections between thalamic with limbic regions compared with preseizure state indicated network regularization during seizures. When comparing between strains, intrathalamic connections were prominent in NEC, on local level represented by higher thalamic strengths and hub scores. Subtle differences were observed for retrosplenial cortex (RS), forming more connections beyond cortex in epileptic rats, and showing a tendency to lateralization during seizures. A potential role of RS as hub between subcortical and cortical regions in epilepsy was supported by increased numbers of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons together with enhanced inhibitory synaptic activity and neuronal excitability in pyramidal neurons. By combining multimodal fMRI data, graph theoretical methods, and electrophysiological recordings, we identified the RS as promising target for modulation of seizure activity and/or comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Testicular torsion, a medical condition contributing to male infertility, results in severe scrotal pain and ischemia. Oxidative stress factors contribute to germ cell death following surgical reperfusion, suggesting postoperative pharmacotherapy could mitigate testicular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Ivermectin, a GABA receptor modulator for treating parasitic infections such as onchocerciasis, has demonstrated anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic properties. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin administration after detorsion using a rat model of testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D). This study utilized 40 male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 grams. The studied groups were the sham (no T/D induction), control (T/D and no treatment), and T/D following administration of ivermectin administration and the doses of 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally. For I/R surgery, both testes were twisted 720 degrees clockwise for 4 h to cause torsion. Subsequently, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using ELISA, while the expression of GABAreceptors and apoptosis were examined using the immunohistochemical method. Histopathological alterations were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to evaluate cell counts and seminiferous tubule diameters. Administration of ivermectin effectively reduced oxidative stress levels, as evidenced by decreased MDA levels and increased SOD activity, compared to the control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Ivermectin also modulated the expression of elevated GABAreceptors and caspase 3 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, histopathological analysis revealed that ivermectin prevented germ cell degeneration, edema, and hemorrhage in the testis (P < 0.05). Ivermectin may be a potential treatment option for protecting against testicular torsion and may have beneficial effects on mitigating germ cell death, oxidative stress, and GABAreceptor modulation. Further research is needed to explore dosages, long-term impacts, and clinical trials to determine the potential for patients with testicular torsion.",

This review will summarize these recent data, demonstrating that SWD are not primary generalized, are not sudden and unpredictable events. It will disentangle different functional contributions of structures within the cortico-thalamo-cortical system, relevant for the generation, generalization, maintenance, and termination of SWD and will present a new \"network based\" scenario for these oscillations. Similarities and differences between rodent and human data are presented demonstrating that in both species a local cortical onset zone of SWD exists, although with different locations; that in both some forms of cortical and thalamic precursor activity can be found, and that SWD occur through repetitive cyclic activity between cortex and thalamus. The focal onset zone in human data could differ between patients with varying spatial and temporal dynamics; in rats the latter is still poorly investigated.",

Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model many aspects of AE including the presence of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral comorbidities, such as elevated anxiety. However, the effects of cannabis plant-based phytocannabinoids have not been tested in GAERS. Therefore, we investigated how SWDs in GAERS are altered by the two most common phytocannabinoids, Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), and exposure to smoke from two different chemovars of cannabis. Animals were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the somatosensory cortex and EEGs were recorded for 2 hr. Injected THC (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased SWDs to over 200% of baseline. In contrast, CBD (30-100 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a ~50% reduction in SWDs. Exposure to smoke from a commercially available chemovar of high-THC cannabis (Mohawk, Aphria Inc.) increased SWDs whereas a low-THC/high-CBD chemovar of cannabis (Treasure Island, Aphria Inc.) did not significantly affect SWDs in GAERS. Pre-treatment with a CB1R antagonist (SR141716A) did not prevent the high-THC cannabis smoke from increasing SWDs, suggesting that the THC-mediated increase may not be CB1R-dependent. Plasma concentrations of THC and CBD were similar to previously reported values following injection and smoke exposure. Compared to injected CBD, it appears Treasure Island did not increase plasma levels sufficiently to observe an anti-epileptic effect. Together these experiments provide initial evidence that acute phytocannabinoid administration exerts the biphasic modulation of SWDs and may differentially impact patients with AE.",

The mechanisms underlying this teratogenicity are not known, but may involve genetic risk factors. This study aimed to develop an animal model of VPA-induced birth defects. We used three different rat strains: inbred Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg (GAERS), a model of GGE with absence seizures; inbred Non-Epileptic Controls (NEC); and outbred nonepileptic Wistars. Female rats were fed standard chow or VPA (20 g/kg food) mixed in standard chow for 2 weeks prior to conception, and then mated with same-strain males. Treatment continued throughout pregnancy. Fetuses were extracted via C-section on gestational day 21 and examined for birth defects, including external assessment and spinal measurements. VPA-exposed pups showed significant reductions in weight, length, and whole-body development compared with controls of all three strains (P < .0001). Gestational VPA treatment altered intravertebral distances, and resulted in underdeveloped vertebral arches between thoracic region T11 and caudal region C2 in most pups (GAERS, 100%; NEC, 95%; Wistar, 80%), more frequently than in controls (9%, 13%, 19%). Gestational VPA treatment results in similar developmental and morphological abnormalities in three rat strains, including one with GGE, indicating that the genetic underpinnings of epilepsy do not contribute markedly to VPA-induced birth defects. This model may be used in future studies to investigate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of antiepileptic drug-induced birth defects.",

The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was 94.27 ± 1.47%. The study found that phenolic release was highest (89.81%) at pH 7.4 (simulated intestinal fluid) and lowest (59.43%) at pH 2 (simulated stomach fluid) after 3 h. This particular type of bead also exhibited significant antioxidant activity, phenolic component content, and flavonoid content. The estimated phenolic content was 66.48 mg GAE/g, with methyl gallate, gallic acid, and naringenin as the main components. In vivo evaluation findings revealed that both doses of alginate/DPP beads (delivering 250 and 350 mg/kg of extract per day) significantly protected the liver (as demonstrated by downregulated liver function parameters), improved levels of male fertility-stimulating hormones, reduced oxidative stress parameters and inflammatory cytokines, and protected both liver and testicular tissues from BPA-induced changes. Thus, the actions of alginate/DPP beads make them a promising choice for antioxidant, liver-protecting, and male hormone-enhancing hydrogels.",

However, in the well-regarded Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model as yet there has been no link described between burst-firing in TR neurons and spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). GAERS ventrobasal (VB) neurons are a specific subset of TR neurons that do not normally display burst-firing during absence seizures in the GAERS model, and here, we assessed the underlying relationship of VB burst-firing with Ih and T-type calcium currents between GAERS and non-epileptic control (NEC) animals. In response to 200-ms hyperpolarizing current injections, adult epileptic but not pre-epileptic GAERS VB neurons displayed suppressed burst-firing compared to NEC. In response to longer duration 1,000-ms hyperpolarizing current injections, both pre-epileptic and epileptic GAERS VB neurons required significantly more hyperpolarizing current injection to burst-fire than those of NEC animals. The current density of the Hyperpolarization and Cyclic Nucleotide-activated (HCN) current (Ih) was found to be increased in GAERS VB neurons, and the blockade of Ih relieved the suppressed burst-firing in both pre-epileptic P15-P20 and adult animals. In support, levels of HCN-1 and HCN-3 isoform channel proteins were increased in GAERS VB thalamic tissue. T-type calcium channel whole-cell currents were found to be decreased in P7-P9 GAERS VB neurons, and also noted was a decrease in CaV3.1 mRNA and protein levels in adults. Z944, a potent T-type calcium channel blocker with anti-epileptic properties, completely abolished hyperpolarization-induced VB burst-firing in both NEC and GAERS VB neurons.",

Investigating parasites of rats and understanding their life cycles have become crucial necessity. The present study aimed to screen for the presence of intestinal parasites and ectoparasites in black rats (Rattus rattus) in Garmian region. An overall 55 live rats (21 male, 34 female) were trapped from three districts in Garmian region (Kalar, Kifri and Khanaqin). The rats were euthanized, dissected and their parasites were identified. The overall rate of infection with at least one parasite was 61.81% (36/55). Four genera of nematodes were identified; Trichuris muris, capillaria spp., Strongyloides sp. and Trichostrongylus sp. with infection rate 20% (11/55). Twenty four out of the 55 rats (43.61%) were infected with Hymenolepis nana and/or Hymenolepis diminuta. Three protozoa were also identified, Giardia muris, Entamoeba muris and Isospora ratti with infection rate of 25.45% (14/55). The flea Xenopsylla cheopis was the only ectoparasite identified from 4 rats (7.27%). Rat from all the three studied areas carried parasites with no significant difference in term of infection rates. Male rats showed significantly higher prevalence of parasites compared to female. Coinfection was observed in rats and some rats carried four types of parasites at one time.  Findings of this study suggest that rats of Garmian region harbor zoonotic parasites which can pose risk to humans and animals. Therefore, actions have to be taken to content the potential of disease transmission.",

      "citations": 2,
      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy, the most common epilepsy of childhood, consists of brief seizures characterized by sudden, transient loss of consciousness, behavioural arrest and a spike-and-wave discharge (SWD)-dominated EEG pattern, which can occur up to hundreds of times per day. It is widely accepted that in both human and genetic rodent models these SWDs are initiated in a hyperexcitable cortical focus and ictal activity is promptly generalized via corticocortical and thalamocortical connections. There are ample experimental demonstrations on the spiking dynamics of the major components of the thalamocortical loop during absence seizures. However, very little is known about the way cortical microcircuitry participates in seizure activity, and in particular the role of cortical interneurons remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, although the genotypic and phenotypic variations of absence epilepsy are well studied, still we have scarce knowledge on epileptogenesis in the seizure-susceptible brain. Therefore pre-existing epileptogenic conditions and seizure-induced alterations of the thalamocortical circuitry have yet to be separated – if this is possible. The study of Studer et al. (2019) in a recent issue of The Journal of Physiology shines new light on these questions. The authors performed a comparative anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural study of genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and non-epileptic Wistar rats in order to identify possible alterations due to the recurrent seizures. First, based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of local field potentials of seizures, they precisely localized for the first time the seizure initiation zone inside the somatosensory cortex, which was found to be in the whisker region (S1Bf). Histological analysis of the putative seizure-onset zone revealed that GAERS expressed an increased density of somatostatin positive (SST) and parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons in layers 4 and 5 of the somatosensory cortex, respectively, compared to the non-epileptic controls. Studer et al. (2019) reported important structural differences between the epileptic and healthy rodent brain, but their study could not differentiate whether these alterations are contributors to the epileptogenesis or part of a compensatory mechanism which tries to dampen the effect of seizures on the cortical circuitry. It is known that during epileptogenesis SWDs progressively become more synchronous with a sharper, more pronounced spike component, reflecting that cortical units are firing more and more synchronously driven by the seizure activity (Jarre et al. 2017). Considering the temporal pattern of the PV cells’ activity (Pouille and Scanziani, 2004), the increased density of PV cells in layer 5 might account for the evolution of the SWD waveform during epileptogenesis, which can constrain the firing of excitatory cells into a narrow temporal windows within each SWD cycle, comparable to the width of the spike component of SWDs ( 20 ms; Jarre et al. 2017). The spectral profile of these sharp troughs can also serve as an explanation for the increased gamma power and SWD–gamma phase amplitude coupling during seizures, which was reported by the authors. Therefore, it is possible that the previously reported gradual change of SWD waveform parallels the increase of PV interneuron number in layer 5, and thus PV cells could be contributors to epileptogenesis. An important aspect is whether these interneurons follow the same local connectivity rules as those in healthy animals. In the healthy brain, layer 4 SST neurons predominantly target local PV interneurons (Tremblay et al. 2016) and the activity of SST neurons is responsible for silencing other interneurons. Thus, via disinhibition, SST cells might strengthen the seizures instead of dampening ictal activity. In contrast, if one hypothesizes that PV cells actively contribute to epileptogenesis by fine-tuning pyramidal cells during the spike components of SWDs, then the reported excess SST neuron pool in layer 4 could serve as a compensatory mechanism to dampen the reverberation of the thalamocortical loop in seizures. To judge if this is the case, it is critical to investigate the anatomical connectivity and firing dynamics of these interneurons during and between seizures. In light of the differences of the cortical interneuron population, Studer et al. (2019) sought to investigate whether any functional deficiency of the epileptic cortex can be identified. They performed multi-unit activity (MUA) and current source density (CSD) analysis on sensory evoked potentials induced by air-puffs; then a texture discrimination test was performed to evaluate the behavioural correlates of the altered cortical microcircuitry. Interestingly, evoked potentials were delayed in GAERS and MUA revealed that cellular entrainment was also different as multi-units were not only activated around the peak of the evoked potential as expected, but 300 ms later a secondary peak of firing was observed. It is somewhat surprising that no sign of this secondary activation was present on the CSD map of the evoked potentials. This clearly requires further investigations to reveal how such a massive concurrent activation of all the layers 2/3, 4 and 5/6 can occur without any obvious sinks or sources on the CSD map. Despite the altered microstructure and evoked potential kinetics, no difference between GAERS and non-epileptic Wistar rats in a texture discrimination test was detectable, and therefore the authors suggest that the sensory circuits of the somatosensory cortex are still able to process whisker-related information. A recent study by Hong et al. (2018), which showed that even in the complete absence of barrel cortex mice are capable of performing whisker-related tasks, provides a cautionary note. In light of this, it is possible that the methods used by Studer et al. (2019) might underestimate the functional impairment of somatosensory cortex, given that other brain regions are able to compensate for the missing or non-functional somatosensory cortex. The work of Studer et al. (2019) revealed important structural alterations of the epileptic brain of GAERS and highlighted that the altered structure of the somatosensory cortex might process sensory information in a substantially",

Dysfunctional feed-forward inhibition (FFI) is implicated as one cause of absence seizures. Previously, we reported altered excitation onto parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in the CTC network of the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. In addition, downstream changes in GABAergic neurotransmission have also been identified in this model. Our current study assessed whether dysfunctional FFI affects GABAreceptor (GABAR) subunit expression in the stargazer primary somatosensory cortex (SoCx). Global tissue expression of GABAR subunits α1, α3, α4, α5, β2, β3, γ2 and δ were assessed using Western blotting (WB), while biochemically isolated subcellular fractions were assessed for the α and δ subunits. We found significant reductions in tissue and synaptic expression of GABAR α1, 18% and 12.2%, respectively. However, immunogold-cytochemistry electron microscopy (ICC-EM), conducted to assess GABAR α1 specifically at synapses between PVinterneurons and their targets, showed no significant difference. These data demonstrate a loss of phasic GABAR α1, indicating altered GABAergic inhibition which, coupled with dysfunctional FFI, could be one mechanism contributing to the generation or maintenance of absence seizures.",

We conducted a randomized cross-over study, incorporating 1-week treatments with E2730 (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneous infusion) or vehicle in epileptic post-KASE rats.

Age-matched, healthy control animals treated with E2730 or vehicle were also studied. E2730 treatment significantly reduced spontaneous seizures, with 8 of 11 animals becoming seizure-free. MRS revealed that E2730-treated animals had significantly reduced taurine levels. [F]Flumazenil PET imaging revealed no changes in GABA receptor affinity or density during E2730 treatment.

Deficits in the prefrontal and hippocampal excitatory/inhibitory balance due to a functional loss of GABAergic interneurons are proposed to underlie these symptoms. Increasing the postsynaptic effects of GABA with compounds that selectively modulate GABAergic receptors could be a potential target for treating ASD symptoms. In addition, deficits in GABAergic interneurons have been linked to dopamine (DA) system dysregulation, and, despite conflicting evidence, abnormalities in the DA system activity may underly some ASD symptoms. Here, we investigated whether the positive allosteric modulator of α5-containing GABAreceptors (α5-GABARs) SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 (10 mg/kg) attenuates behavioral abnormalities in rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA) in utero, an established risk factor for autism. We also evaluated if animals exposed to VPA in utero present changes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA system activity using in vivo electrophysiology and if SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 could attenuate these changes. SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before each behavioral test and electrophysiology. In utero VPA exposure caused male and female rats to present increased repetitive behavior (self-grooming) in early adolescence and deficits in social interaction in adulthood. Male, but not female VPA rats, also presented deficits in recognition memory as adults. SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 attenuated the impairments in sociability and cognitive function in male VPA-exposed rats without attenuating the decreased social interaction in females. Adult male and female VPA-exposed rats also showed an increased VTA DA neuron population activity, which was not changed by SH-053-2'F-R-CH3.

After epileptic rats or seizure-susceptible rats were sporadically found in outbred stocks, the epileptic traits were usually genetically-fixed by selective breeding. So far, the absence seizure models GAERS and WAG/Rij, audiogenic seizure models GEPR-3 and GEPR-9, generalized tonic-clonic seizure models IER, NER and WER, and Canavan-disease related epileptic models TRM and SER have been established. Dissection of the genetic bases including causative genes in these epileptic rat models would be a significant step toward understanding epileptogenesis. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis provides a systematic approach which allowed us to develop two novel epileptic rat models: heat-induced seizure susceptible (Hiss) rats with an Scn1a missense mutation and autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) model rats with an Lgi1 missense mutation. In addition, we have established episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) model rats with a Kcna1 missense mutation derived from the ENU-induced rat mutant stock, and identified a Cacna1a missense mutation in a N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mutant rat strain GRY, resulting in the discovery of episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) model rats. Thus, epileptic rat models have been established on the two paths: 'phenotype to gene' and 'gene to phenotype'.

In rats, predator odor stress increases alcohol intake in animals that show persistent avoidance of stress-paired stimuli, termed \"Avoiders\". Here, we tested the hypothesis that Avoider rats have blunted sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects using an alcohol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. After a single conditioning session, Non-Avoider rats acquired alcohol-induced CTA while Avoiders did not. Male rats across all groups eventually acquired alcohol CTA after four conditioning sessions. However, in females, only Non-Avoiders acquired alcohol-induced CTA. In male Non-Avoider rats, a single CTA-inducing dose of alcohol increased cFos expression in the lateral habenula (LHb), an important nucleus in aversion signaling. In male Avoiders, the same dose of alcohol decreased LHb cFos expression. cFos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which provides glutamatergic inputs to the LHb, was also diminished by alcohol in male Avoider rats. In females, alcohol had no effect on cFos cell counts in the LHb. However, in the LH, alcohol diminished cFos expression in female Non-Avoiders. Collectively, these findings suggest that stressed Avoider rats are hyposensitive to alcohol's aversive effects, which may facilitate their heightened alcohol drinking after stress. Sex- and stress group-specific differences in LH and LHb recruitment highlight these regions as candidates for mediating stress-induced changes in alcohol behaviors.",

      "abstract": "A non-proteinaceous amino acid called GABA is well-known for its physiological uses and its role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain of mammals. Apart from its neurological function, GABA has been linked to blood pressure reduction and glucose balance modulation. Since β-cell destruction and decreased insulin secretion are hallmarks of diabetes mellitus, the natural production of GABA by pancreatic β-cells increases the possibility of its therapeutic role. The aim of this study was to produce, purify, and characterize GABA from glutamic acid and assess its potential as an antidiabetic, namely to impact β-cell proliferation. GABA was produced from glutamic acid using the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). After that, the produced GABA was purified and characterized using different analytical methods. Furthermore, in vivo studies were carried out with diabetic mice to evaluate the effect of GABA treatment on β-cell proliferation and control of insulin levels. GABA treatment improved glycaemic control in diabetic mice by increasing β-cell proliferation and regulating glucagon and insulin production. These results demonstrate the potential of GABA as an antidiabetic drug and provide a safe substitute for traditional insulin injections. Further study is needed to understand its mechanism of action and investigate its therapeutic application in the treatment of diabetes.",

It is estimated that if treatment stays as usual by 2025 the death rate will increase to 165,00.Therefore, we are encouraging the scientific and clinical community to at least consider our \"out of the box\" thinking whereby we are proposing a new paradigm shift involving the \" dopaminergic homeostatic modeling approach and Genetic screening to early identify preaddiction. In this novel approach following detoxification from for example powerful opioids, the patient is administered the validated RDSQ29 to access potential psychological profiling of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS); obtain a cheek cell sample of the patient and perform genetic screening utilizing the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS); analyze mRNA to identify specific protein deficits/surfeits based on the measured reward genes involved in the Brain Reward Cascade (BRC); produce a customized pro-dopamine regulator (KB220) guided by GARS resulting polymorphisms; objectively employ the mRNA profiling assessment every week during the treatment phase to determine improvement; each treatment program could add on at their choice, for example, cognitive behavioral therapy, brain spotting, trauma therapy, electrotherapy (h-wave device to reduce pain, subluxation repair etc.) mindfulness, exercise, neuromodulation (PrTMS) amongst other modalities. The utilization of this model could prove beneficial to both substance and non-substance behavioral addictions (e. g. gaming). WC261 .",

      "abstract": "Absence epilepsy belongs to genetic epilepsies and is characterized by recurrent generalized seizures that are concomitant with alterations of consciousness and associated with cognitive comorbidities. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to occurrence of epileptic seizures (i.e. epileptogenesis) and, in particular, it remains an open question as to whether neuronal hypersynchronization, a key feature in seizure initiation, could result from aberrant structural connectivity within neuronal networks endowing them with epileptic properties. In the present study, we addressed this question using a genetic model of absence epilepsy in the rat where seizures initiate in the whisker primary somatosensory cortex (wS1). We hypothesized that alterations in structural connectivity of neuronal networks within wS1 contribute to pathological neuronal synchronization responsible for seizures. First, we used rabies virus-mediated retrograde synaptic tracing and showed that cortical neurons located in both upper- and deep-layers of wS1 displayed aberrant and significantly increased connectivity in the genetic model of absence epilepsy, as highlighted by a higher number of presynaptic partners. Next, we showed at the functional level that disrupting these aberrant wS1 neuronal networks with synchrotron X-ray-mediated cortical microtransections drastically decreased both the synchronization and seizure power of wS1 neurons, as revealed by in vivo local field potential recordings with multichannel probes. Taken together, our data provide for the first time strong evidence that increased structural connectivity patterns of cortical neurons represent critical pathological substrates for increased neuronal synchronization and generation of absence seizures.",

      "abstract": "Quinoa () is classified as one of the pseudo-cereal grains rich in both macronutrients and micronutrients. This study tracks changes in the polyphenol composition of red quinoa (RQ) and yellow quinoa (YQ) seeds during germination. The antioxidant bioactivity of raw and germinated seed was also determined in vitro. Phenolic acids and their derivatives and flavonoids were identified by using HPLC-DAD and quantified after 0, 3, and 6 days of germination. Subsequently, the extracts of 6-day-old quinoa sprouts were prepared to biologically evaluate their functional properties against CCl-induced oxidative stress in rats. The results indicated that antioxidant activity (AOA) of total phenolic compounds (TPC), and flavonoids significantly increased in RQ and YQ sprouts during germination up to 9 days. RQ sprouts exhibited stronger bioactive compound diversity than YQ sprouts as observed in HPLC analysis. Among the 11 and 8 quantified polyphenols, ferulic acid and quercetin were predominant phenolic acid and flavonoid in RQ and YQ sprouts, respectively. After 6 days of germination, 16 and 8 polyphenols were detected and quantified in RQ and YQ sprouts, respectively. Interestingly, the treatment of rats at a dose of 30 mg of Gallic acid Equivalent (GAE) kgsignificantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase AST, and total bilirubin (TIBIL) and improved liver inflammation. Furthermore, RQ and YQ sprouts improved the blood profile by significantly decreasing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and increasing high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Moreover, RQ and YQ sprout extracts significantly reduced malonaldehyde (MDA) and efficiently enhanced the reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in oxidative stress-induced rats as compared to CCl-rats. In conclusion, red quinoa sprouts (RQS) and yellow quinoa sprouts (YQS) provide naturally synthesized polyphenols, possessing superior antioxidant activity, and their ethanolic extracts have promising effects and potential health benefits to counter induced oxidative stress. Incorporating quinoa sprouts as functional food ingredients should be considered and scaling-up its production is beneficial.",

      "abstract": "Increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma is closely associated with convulsive epilepsy and symptom severity of depression. By comparison, at present, little is known about the role of this cytokine in childhood (non-convulsive) absence epilepsy. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential effects of acute and chronic treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day), on absence seizures, their development, and related psychiatric comorbidity in WAG/Rij rats. It is known that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced changes in inflammatory processes increase absence epileptic activity. In order to study the central effects of TCZ, we investigated whether administration of this anti-IL-6R antibody could modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-6-evoked changes in absence epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats. Our results demonstrate that TCZ, at both doses, significantly reduced the development of absence seizures in adult WAG/Rij rats at 6 months of age (1 month after treatment suspension) compared with untreated controls, thus showing disease-modifying effects. Decreased absence seizure development at 6 months of age was also accompanied by reduced comorbid depressive-like behavior, whereas no effects were observed on anxiety-related behavior. Acute treatment with TCZ, at 30 mg/kg, had anti-absence properties lasting ~25 h. The co-administration TCZ with i.c.v. LPS or IL-6 showed that TCZ inhibited the worsening of absence seizures induced by both proinflammatory agents in the WAG/Rij rats, supporting a central anti-inflammatory-like protective action. These results suggest the possible role of IL-6 and consequent neuroinflammation in the epileptogenic process underlying the development and maintenance of absence seizures in WAG/Rij rats. Accordingly, IL-6 signaling could be a promising pharmacological target in absence epilepsy and depressive-like comorbidity.",
